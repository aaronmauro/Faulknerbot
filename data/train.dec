 I'd like for us to introduce this group toeople generally in the back aee it are dedicated souls who've given ureat deal maybe even breakfast  to come in here and who are official auditors of this class today and scattered toward the front are the real card-carrying dues-paying members olass in American fiction who havew questions anew comments possibly on work we've been doing in the course which has taken us from the—when was it—the first day that Ikkemotubbe came back from New Orleans right up through the McCaslin and Compson sagas to the Easter when Dilsey said she'd seed the first and the last.
And as for introducino this group it is something that needs not to be done buhink it might make this moment even more historical in our minds iemind you that there is no writer in the world today whose prestige is higher than this gentleman from Mississippie will be at ease and questions may or may not come in the next few minutes.
now I've got one somewhere so iay I'd like to ask what you felt was the relationship between The Sound and the Fury and the short story "That Evening Sun."
Did one come before the other in some significant wayhe—"That Evening Sun" must have come after The Sound and the Fury.
The first timhought of—of those children Caddy and Jason and Quentin was wheid The Sound and the Fury so the other story must've come after it though it's hard to—for me to unravel these people to say when one came to life.
It's very difficultyself can't distinguish one book from another sometimeshink not of books but of characters anan't remember which book has which characters in it.
Do you remember any kind of feeling of satisfaction when you finally finished The Sound and the Fury?hink most readers feel a—a great equilibrium at the end there.
Do you recall any such feeling yourselfon't.
That's the—the one thaove the best for the reason that it was the most splendid failurehink that—that they all failed.
Probably the reason the man writes another book is that he tried to—to tell some very important and very moving truth and failed.
He's not satisfied so he tries again.
He writes another book trying to tell some—the same moving truth since there's only one truth and they fail.
And this onorked hardest at.
It's—it's like the—the idiot child that the parents love the best.
This one was the—the most splendid failure but I—I wisadn't done it because iould do it nohinould do it better.
Of coursouldn't  buould like to try it again iad never written itYes ma'am.This iuestion about writing in generalhink maybe you just answered it but they say until Hawthorne came along that there were two ways to constructory either start with the characters and thelot or start witlot and make up your characters and they say that Hawthorne started with the idea and invented both.
Anondenow there's no one formula to producintory buust wonder where you start most often and what you feel is most important what pattern you have worked out to usehree methods you just stated all will work but—but none—neither or none are more important than the others and no one can say just what method the story demands.
Apparently there's something inside the man or the woman that must be—be told must be written.
It could be an anecdote.
It could bharacter.
It could be an idea buon't think you could say which system to—or which pattern to assume in order to—to creattory oook.You have no favorite pattern?
It just depends on the individual—hat's right that's right.
It could be an anecdote.
The Sound and the Fury came out of an anecdoticture of a—a little girl the muddy seat of her drawers when she climbed the tree to look iarlor window and that's—the book came from thatir.In The Sound and the Fury the first three sections of that book are narrated by one of the—of the four Compson children and in view of the fact that Caddy figures so prominently is there any particular reason why you didn't havection with—giving her views or impressions of what went onhat'ood question.
That—the explanation of that whole book is in that.
It began with the—the picture of the—the little girl's muddy drawers climbing that tree to look in the parlor window with her brothers that didn't have the courage to climb the tree waiting to see what she saw.
anried first to tell it with one brother and that wasn't enough.
That was Section Oneried with another brother and that wasn't enough.
That was Section Tworied the third brother because Caddy was still to me too beautiful and too moving to—to reduce her to telling what was going on that it would be more—more passionate to see her through somebody else's eyehought.
And that failed anried myself the fourth section to tell what happened antill failed.
So—  when you wrote this did you have it thought out beforehand the whole sequences or did they sort of evolve as you wrote itt evolved arote it.
It began with the picture aaid of—of the little girl climbing the tree to tell her brothers what was going on in the room where the grandmother's funeral was taking place and the rest grew from that.
Speaking of Caddy is there any way of getting her back from the clutches of the Nazis  where she ends up in—in the appendix think that that would betrayal of Caddy that it's best to leave her where she is.
If she were resurrected there'd be somethinittle shabbittle anti-climatic about it about this.
Her tragedy to me is—is the besould do with it.
Unless aaiould start over and write the book again whican't do.
since we still seem to be discussing The Sound and the Furavuestion.
In Parts Three and Four of The Sound and the Fury the presentation of character is usually clear and convincing.
The reader can never forget the viciousness of Jason or the amiable simplicity of Luster or the selfishness of Caroline.
The reader comes to know these people through watching them act.
At the same timhall say for the sake of discussion that the action in these two parts occasionally seems contrived.
For example why does not Candice solve the problem of getting money to her daughter by depositing it in Quentin's name or by sending gifts to Quentin gifts that Jason could not use.
Yet the vivid character development and ideas in this novel depends upon the action as we have it.
Does not this show one of the dilemmas of art?
That is the difficulty of showing at the same time realistic character and action and since the one must be somewhat sacrificed to the other is not the expression of an idea or the presentation of the character more important artistically than the writing of realistic actions would say that the—the creation oharacter is the most important of all.
Is—that is what the—the writer's trying to do that he—he would use style when—when he thinks style is the tool best.
He will use misrepresentation when that's what he thinks will serve best.
He will use some—some outrageous—what—what arying to think now?
He—he will have—he's writing talking about one primary truth which has nothing to do with fact so he will outrage fact.
He will outrage simplicity.
If he can find no better way to—to tell to show some passionate and moving facet of the human heart which moved him so much that he couldn't let be what he had to write.
Does that answer your question?
Yes sirYes ma'am.I am interested in the—in the symbolism in The Sound and the Fury anasn't able to figure out exactly the significance of the shadow symbol with Quentin.
It's referred to over and over again.
He steps into the shadow his shadow is before him his shadow is over him after him behind.
More importantly what is the significance of this shadowhat wasn'eliberate symbolismould say that that—that shadow that stayed on his mind so much was a—a foreknowledge of his own death that he was—death is here shaltep into it or—or shaltep away from iittle longer?on't escape it but shalccept it now or shalut it off until next Friday or—I think that was—if it had any reason that must have been it.
on the subject of symbolism two or three years ago Carl Sandburg was asked to interpret one of his works ....
He ... that he didn't read the stuff he just wrote it all of which in view of the fact that too many people particularly professors go to this extreme on symbolism.
Do you think most authors are conscious at the time they're doing symbols or using symbols that—are they conscious of everything they bring into it or is this just somethinood artist automatically does without realizing it don't think that he's conscious of it unless as we saioment ago symbolism is some tool that he is using for lack oetter one.
But no he's—he's not conscious of it.
The symbolism lots of times is read into it.
Of course he put it there but he didn't know it was there until somebody told him about it.
Certainly something like "The Bear" you must've felt that the bear himself was—stood for something more than jusig bear as—  Well but he was such an obvious symbol.
He represented the vanishing wilderness.
He was an obvious symbol.Sir what sort of symbol was the snake?
We discussed that in both "The Bear" and in "Red Leaves."
Oh the snake is—is—is the old grandfather the old fallen angel the unregenerate immortal.
The—the—the good and shining angel ain't very interesting you know.
It's the dark proud one that's interesting.Sir what would you adviserson to read first of yoursell that's noair question to ask me becausould—I would like anyone to try the one thaove the best which ioor one to start on.
If you are asking me to give an objective answeould say maybe—maybe The Unvanquished.Why would you select that oneecause it's easy to read.
Compared to the otherean.Would it be fair to ask you what is your favorite of your bookshe Sound and the Fury yes.Thank you.
I'd like to ask you about Quentin and his fatherhink many readers get the impression that Quentin is the way he is targe extent because of his father's lack of values or the fact that he doesn't seem to pass down to his son many values that will sustain him.
Do you think that Quentin winds up the way he does primarily because of that or are we meant to see would you say that the action comes primarily from what he is just abetted by what he gets from his fatherhe action as portrayed by Quentin was transmitted to him through his father.
There was a—a basic failure before that.
The grandfather had beeailed brigadier twice in the Civil War.
It was the—the basic failure Quentin inherited through his father or beyond his father.
It was a—it's—something had happened somewhere between the first Compson and—and Quentin.
The first Compson was a—a bold ruthless man who came into Mississippi aree forester to—to grasp where and when he could and wanted to and established what should have beerincely line and that princely line decayed.Sir how do you feel about your books after they've gone to press?
Do you reread them or do you feel that they're cast—cast in stone didn't hear you.I said how do you feel about your books after they've gone to press?
Do you reread them and puzzle over them or do you ...on't because by that timnow the book was not as good as it should've been and so I'm usually busy at another one.
Aeneral rule you never re-reado that's—that one book the writer don't have to read any more.
Sir what are some of the problems thaerson who is trying to publish his first novel would run into?
In other words how may he to his—to his best advantage to get his first work in publicationt's difficult to sayhink that if the writer is too interested in getting that book printed to where that takes up that much of his time that he's not reallirst-rate writer.
Probably the first-rate writer is angry and mad but—but only when he brings himself to think about that first book.
He's—he's working on the second one by that time.
He's still trying to tell that truth which by—by then he knows he failed in the first one so he's—he's not interested in—in that book anymore.
He wants it printed of course.
The mechanics of it is simply to send it publisher and then forget about it and work on the next one and when it comes back send it to another publisher.
Forget about it until you know that there's something basically wrong in that book something unprintable about it and then put it away and write another one and maybe after you have written another one you will have learned more about the trade.
You can see what might've been mechanically wrong in the first one.
You can go back to that.
I've done that once buon't think that you should worry too much about getting the stuff printed.
The main thing is to write it.Sir you are reported as having said that you rate writers according to what they have attempted rather than what they have achieved.
It seems that Wolfe and Hemingway and yourself are primarily concerned with the conflicts that plague and disturan's soul.
In—in what particular way would you say that Wolfe's attempt was greater than that of you or Hemingwayn that—that he—he ventured more and tried harder to—to inscribe the whole history of man's heart on the head oin say.
That's—that's not clear.
That's not exactly it.
What I'm trying to say is that—that what any writer wants to be is not better than—than the—his—his friend Hemingway or his friend Dos Passos.
He wants to be better than Cervantes or Dostoevsky and sate my coevals as to how near they were to Cervantes or Dostoevsky in—only in relation to one another.
That none of them none of us were quite as good as Cervantes or Dostoevsky that we all fail that there's no—there're no degrees of failure in—in art.
It either is or it ain't.
And Wolfe in my opinion risked more.
He tried harder to—to use the short span of—of one life to inscribe the history of the human heart on the head of the pin.
That Hemingway founethod that he could do marvelously well and stayed in it.
Wolfe didn't.By that method do you mean his—his style of writing short works iery pure limited languagees that's right.
That was—was perfect but minor.
But there're no degrees of—of failure.
No the best is—is the best and the best is—is to—to put inside the covers oook the—the complete turmoil and experience and insight of the human heart which is what Cervantes did what Dostoevsky did but—but Hemingway and us the five thaentioned we—we attempted that but none of us did it.
None of us failed worse—more than another but the best failure was the one that tried the hardest that was the bravest that used the most courage and that in my opinion was Wolfe.Sir do you rate Hemingway any higher since the publication of his last book The Old Man and the Seaot in—by the—the formulsehink that the last book was—was his best and now if we're talking of—of Hemingway yes that was his best that—that he has steadily improved and the last in my opinion was the best and the next one should be still better but it doesn't look ... but what he has done is enough foan to—to die in peace with but it's not enough foan to say "I have done whaanted to do" because nobody can do quite that.
Probably Dostoevsky and Cervantes felt that way.
Marlowe felt that way probably.
That if you ever do write that perfect one then you—you break the pencil and throw it away and there's nothing else to do except cut your throat.
Sir when you are reading for your own pleasure which authors do you consistently return tohe oneame to love wheas eighteen nineteen twenty years old.
Moby-Dick the Old Testament Shakespearot of Conrad Dickensead Don Quixote every year.
you speak of writing the—the one great book but in your own works you—you keep returning to this fictitious county you've made.
You don't consider thaageant the—the whole work.
It was from the Indians through the early settlers—o it was not my intention to—to write a—a—a pageant of a—oountyimply was using the quickest tool to handas using whanew best which was the locale wheras born and had lived most of my life.
That was just like the carpenter building the fence he uses the—the—the nearest hammer.
It—onlidn't realize myself thaas creating a—a—a pageantry oarticular part of the earth.
That just simplified things to me.Well of course ... could be more than just the development oarticular part of the earth—...
Yes it could be sure.
That's right.
when foime you left that area to go to France iable it must've appeared perhaps that it waifferent aspect to this fundamental truth.
Yes.That you were—  But—but the same truth.
It was still an attempt to tell that fundamental single moving truth that was—was so moving and so disturbing to me thaad to do something about it and the only thinnew to do about it was to try to put it down on paper anas just using the nearest and most available and simplest tool by leaving my apocryphal county for another milieu wasn't trying to writar story nor trying to write another War and Peace nor to—to writable evenas simply using the quickest the simplest tool to try to tell the same fundamental truth which had worried me for fifty years.
In "The Bearany readers come across Part Four and—and find it written in quitifferent style than the other parts and the conclusion—well it gets far ahead in years beyond Part Five.
Was there any conscious plan in thatnly this.
"The Bear" was art novel.
That novel was—happened to be composed of—of more or less complete stories but—but it was held together by—by one family the—the Negro and—and the white phase of the same family the same people.
"The Bear"—ean Go Down Moses.
Yeah "The Bear" was just a—jusart of that—novel.
So that it was all right for Ike to think ahead or ... to run up to his thirty-fifth year—  Yes that's right because the rest of the book waart of his past too.
To have taken that story out to print it alonave always removed that part whicave done in one anthology.
Yes some of the textbooks do that.
As a—ahort storong short story it has no part in it but to me "The Bear" is part of the novel jushapter in the novel Yes ma'am.There'orld of difference between wanting to express yourself and actually applying the elbow grease tirst painful attempt anonder what made you bridge this gulf or what—do your remember what—when you first discovered your own compulsion to write think wheas about twenty twenty-one twenty-two.I was wondering if there was an incident or—or if you always wanted to write don't think sohink that—that all the time this qualitpeak of as—as the truth had been worrying me trying to get out and—and nobody likes to work at leason't like to work and I—I reckout it off as long aould but it wouldn't be quiet and let me alonead to try to do something about it which was to put it down.In what period of development did you write that book of poemreen Boughhat was written at the time when—when you write poetry which is seventeen eighteen nineteen  When you—you write poetry just for the pleasure of—of writing poetry and you don't think of printing it until later.
It may be— I've often thought that—tharote the novels becausounouldn't write the poetry that maybanted to boet.
Maybhink of myself aoet anailed at thatouldn't write poetry sid the next best thing.
in your speech at Stockholm you expressed great faith in mankind that you thought man not only was here to prevail because he had the capacity for compassion and sacrifice and endurance.
Do you think that's the impression the average reader would get after reading The Sound and the Fury can't answer that becauson't know what the—what the average reader gets from—from reading the book.
I—I agree that wharied to saailed to say anever have had time to read reviews son't know what impression people might get from the book.
But—but in my opinion yes that's whaas talking about in all of the books buailed to say itgree with yoid fail.
But that's whaas trying to say that man will prevail will endure because he is capable of compassion and honor and pride and endurance.Sir why do you use violence so often in trying to arrive at this truth'm sorryouldn't hear.Why do you use violence so often in your novels in trying to depict this truthell that's the—the carpenter that—that thinks that the ax ietter tool to use thaammer.
He could be wrong but he's using what seemed to him the best tool to properly build what he wants to build.Sir Hawthorne seemed to have found trouble in creating good characters whereas his more or less bad characters stand out as—as works of art.
Do you think that iroblem with all writers that it's harder to create a—a good character than a—than an evil onet's possible that that's inherent in human nature not so much in the—in the character of writers but in—in human nature itself.
That it's easier to conceive of—of evil than of good or to make—that evil is easier to make believable credible than good.
when you say man will prevail do you mean individual man has prevailed or group man has prevailedan as a—a part of—of life.Well but in Quentin for instance he seems to have the cards stacked against him and his prevailing—it seems to be inherently impossible anondered—  True and his mother wasn't much good and he had an idiot brother and yet in that whole family there was Dilsey that held the whole thing together and would continue to hold the whole thing together for no reward that the—the will of man to prevail will even take the—the—the nether channel of—of the black man black race before it will relinquish succumb or be defeated.
As she says "I've known God to use curioser tools than that."
Yes.Well sir if you—if you seem to have this belief in in that ... you say the ultimate goodness of man that he will come through in spite of all.
How—how do you explain sort of the mass brutality the things we practice on each other the horrible things that take place in the lines of religion or our politics didn't say in the ultimate goodness of maaid only that man will prevail and will—and—and in order to prevail he has got to improve.
As to whether he will stay on the earth long enough to attain ultimate goodness nobody knows.
But he—he does improve since the only alternative to progress is death.
And we can see that little children don't have to work.
A—a merchant can't sell you poisoned food.
They are minor improvements but they are improvements.
Nobody is hanged for stealing bread any more.
People are not put in jail for debt.
It's some improvement.
It's noreat dearant you as matched against atomic bombs and things like that.
But it's some improvement.
Man improves.You don't feel that mass manipulation by fanatics along ideological or political lines will negate all thison't.
That to me is part of the ferment of—of—man's immortality that these people the—the nuts are necessary too.Do you think that man will prevail against destroying himself or ... force of nature think he will—he will prevail against his own self-destruction yes.What about the forces of nature too—as part of your scheme too—ell unless the earth gets sick and tired of him like an old dog and just scratches him off like the old dog does fleas which—is not likely to happen.
what do you think is man's most important tool?
Is it the mind or the heart as far as the human goes?
Do we feel this or do we think think our way through it don't have much confidence in the mindhink that here is where it should be that the mind lets you down sooner or later but this doesn't.
I've been very much interested in what it seems to me you did—maybe you didn't—in The Sound and the Fury in the character of Caddy.
To me she iery sympathetic character and perhaps the most sympathetic white woman in the book and yet we get pictures of her only through someone else's comments and most of these comments are quite hostile and—and wouldn't lead you to admire her on the surface and yet—and yeo.
Did you mean for us to have this feeling about Caddy and if so how did you go about reducing it by these negative pictures that we get of hero me she was the—the beautiful one.
She was—she was my heart's darling.
That's wharote the book about—Well that's wha  Ansed the—the tools which seemed to me the—the proper tools to try to tell—try to draw the picture of Caddywe've gooker player over here  Jordan who's holding back ouestion that I'm dying to hear the answer to.
Let's have it.Welas wondering in the short story "Was" why  Hubert does not call Uncle Buddy.
It seems to me that must be the point of the story and yet no one can—could understand why he did not call him.
I'll have to look at that—that page againon't remember exactly the—  He looks up and see that Tomey's Turl is dealing the cards.
Oh Tomey's Turl wants to be free and so Tomey's Turl has dealt the right card to the right one and  Hubert knows that.
As soon as he sees that Tomey's Turl was the one that dealt the cards he knows that he's beat.But Tomey's Turl—Tomey's Turl stood to win either way didn't he?ean he was the—  No he was—I don't remember the story too well buon't think so.
That—that Tomey's Turl hatake in that game too.
As I—I remember it Hubert Beauchamp would have taken his brother—no what are the names?an't even remember the names.
The names were Buck and Buddy.
Yes Buck would have taken Buddy out of the clutches of Miss—what's her nameophonsiba.
Sophonsiba if he had won.
And if that had happened then he would have taken Tomey's Turl back with him away from Tomey's Turl's girl.
So if—if—if Buck lost then Miss Sophonsiba would take Tomey's Turl's girl home with—with—with her.
So Tomey's Turl was playing for his sweetheart.
Yes that's what the story wahink.
Well since  Jordan knows that no self-respecting southern poker play is gonna mishance to call—  Well I'm glad that came upemember that—yes I'm sure that's it that Tomey's Turl hatake too and when Buck saw that Tomey's Turl had dealt that last card he knew that he was finished.I have another question about "The Bear."
In the final scene of "The Bear" Boon is sitting under the tree with the squirrels doing something with his shotgun and it's not clear to me whether he is taking his shot—destroying his shotgun or trying to put it back together.
It had jammed.
He was trying to geammed shell out to make it fire and he didn't want anybody else to shoot the squirrels.
He was under the tree where the squirrels couldn't get out of it and he didn't want anybody else to shoot the squirrels until he could get his gun fixed.
did you conceive of "The Wild Palms" and "The Old Man" aingle storyad—had an enormous amount of trouble trying to link the two stories together.
That was tour de forcerote the—the book just as you read it chapter by chapter.
The storas telling was of the—of Charlotte and—and Harry Wilburimply used the other story as a—as counterpoint just as the musician would to emphasize whaas telling about Harry and Charlotte.Well "The Wild Palms" is so very interestinghink the other iit otruggleust wondered—  Well you—you may be right.
They—aay they all failed and maybe it waistake to—to dovetail two of them together that way but to me it seemed that—that it was necessary to—to counterpoint the story of Harry and Charlotte whicid with—with the complete antithesis—the man that haoman he didn't want and was going to infinite trouble even as far as going to jail to get rid of her.
Masouple of questions about the early Indian stories about "Red Leaves"?
Did Doom in your mind did he wreck the steamboat and maybe kill this man David Callicoat whose name he took?
Did he have some notion of getting that steamboat eventually which he finally had transported twelve miles inlando the steamboat simply got too far up the river and stayed too long and when the water fell in the late summer it couldn't get out again and so the owners of it just took the valuable machinery out and left the hull there and Doom decided that would makice addition to his house and so he had his people drag it out of the river across to the plantation.
Did you ever hear of anyone's really ever doing that .. No.
Were these Chickasaws ever known to be cannibals?
There's some mention of how human flesh may have tasted between two of them once.
No there's—there's no record but then it's—who's to say whether at some time one of them might not have tried what it tasted like?
Quite often young boys will try things that they are—are horrified to remember later just to see what it was like what the sensation was like.
Maybe as children they may have founead man and cooked some of him to see what he tasted like.
But they were not cannibals as far anow.Do they exist just in memory now—here arew.
There'eservatioemnant of—of Choctaws.
The others the Indians in my part of Mississippi have vanished into the two races either the white race or the Negro race.
You see traces of the features in the Negroes anew of the old names in—in among white families old white families.Is iuestiof if there were Indians at one time in this areah yes.
Yes all the—the land records go back to—to the Indian patents and our country's not very old.
Our land records are onlundred and fifty years old.
That was frontier then.Sir I'm curious about the occasional changes in personality that some of your characters undergo between novels.
For instance Narcissa Benbow is fairly sympathetic in Sartoris but by the time you write Sanctuary she's vicious.
How do you account for thishere agaim using the—the most available tool to tell what I'm trying to tell and my idea is that—that no person is wholly good or wholly bad that all people in my belief try to be better than they are and probably will be.
And that if—wheeed foooarticular quality in an individuahink that quality is there.
It can be taken out and—and for the moment it leaves the individual in an—an unhappy light.
But in my opinion it hasn't destroyed nor really harmed that individual.In other words sir she hadn't developed between novels.
You're merely takinifferent look at her as the same person.
That's right.
That's right.Sir to what extent are you—were you trying to picture the South or southern civilization ahole rather than just Mississippi or were youot at allas trying to talk about people using the only toonew which was the country thanew.
Nasn't trying to—to—wasn't writing sociology at all.
audience laughteas just trying to write about people which to me are the important .... Just the human heart.
It's not—not ideason't know anything about ideas don't have much confidence in them.
In "The Bearnce again the—the end of Part Three Sam Fathers has died.
Does he die in his own little cabin or does he ask Boon Hogganbeck and Ike to take him out and expose him on the four-cornered platforme knew that he was finished.
He was tired of—of his life and he—if he had been strong he could have done the deed himself.
He couldn't.
He asked Boon to anhink Book murdered him because Sam told him to.
It was the Greek gesture which Sam himself was too weak to do.
He was done finished.
He told Boon to do it.
And Ike knows this and he tells the others to let Boon aloneke knows this.
Yes that's right.
That's right.
That's right.
Is there another pressing question to bring forth at this time?
Well thank you very mucn this occasion.
We know it's the first oumber and we look forward to the repetition.
Good.
Well thank you all for being kind enough to listen and to come here hungry.
... what he means and probably any story that can't be told in one sentence or at least one paragraph is not worth writing.
The—the revision the—the cutting out—in my own case I'm lazyon't like to work and sill do as much of it as possible in—in the mind in thinking beforndertake the arduous hateful job of swatting it out on paperhink the revision quite often follows because when the job is down on paper at last it still is not quite what it should be and so you—you—you change you revise you edit you—you try to bring it closest to the ideal of perfection which of course you're not going to reach either.
That is what I'm trying to say is that the revision ihink for the writer more than—than the editor's revision which is for the reader.Yes.Do you work so to speak eight houray aesk and just concentrate on it all day long or do you just sort of let it come to you and work spasmodicallyhink that—that the writer never quits working.
All the time he's awake in aay in my own casut off the actual work as long as possible but probably all the time I'm awake I'm thinking about the particular job I'm at at the time anork at it only wheave to.
The only rulave is to quit while it's still hot.
Never write yourself out.
Always quit when it's going good.
Then it's easier to—to take it up again.
If you exhaust yourself then you'll get into a—a dead spell and you have trouble with it.
It's—what's the saying Leave them while you're looking good.
Did you havuestion Thomas?
Yes'm particularly interested in your style anould like to know have you developed it consciously and has it changed very much since when you first began to write did not develop ithink style is one of the tools of the craft anhink anyone that—that spends too much of his time about his style developintyle or followintyle probably hasn't got much to say and knows it and is afraid of it and so he writes a—a stylarvelous trove.
He becomes Walter Pater which is beautiful but there ain't too much in it.
audience laughtehink style is simply one of the tools of the craft.
That—that—the—the story you're telling commands its style that one style is good for now and another style will be good for tomorrow.
And—and like the good carpenter one should—should be able to—well you might say almost imitate that there's some things that certain men have—women writers have told better than others have which iood tool to use if you're trying to—to give the same effect that that man or woman gave but the style is—is incidentahink.In other words it's intuitivehat's right yes.
That the—the story commands its style and iay creates its style.
But you're writing primarily about people.
do you think thariter can teach young writers don't think anybody can teach anybody anything.
audience laughtehink that you learn it but—but the young writer that is aay demon-driven and—and wants to learn and has—has got to write he don't know why he will learn from—from almost any source that he finds.
He will learn from older people who are not writers he will learn from writers but he learns it.
You can't teach it.
Thehink too that the—that the writer who's actually hot to say something hasn't got time to be taught.
He's too busy learning.
He knows what he wants.
His instinct says to take this from this man or that from that man but he's not—he hasn't got time to sit undeentor and listen to try to learn.
to get back to the business of style for jusinute.
You mentioned in some class thattended that Dostoevsky and Conrad were two people you reaood deal when you were eighteen and nineteen years old.
Would you say that you had gotten something in the way of arrangement of words from Conrad?
Every now and then in your stories—I was thinking oouple of passages in "The Bear" passages here and there in other stories—there are arrangements of cadence rhythm that seems to me to be rather like Conrad.
I'm thinking oassage in "Youth" an arrangement of adjectives "resplendent yet somber full of danger yet promising."
It's the description of the East when that young boy comes upon it.
There's something of the same kind of use of those kind of—kind of heavy arrangement of adjectives I've noticed in your writing.
Does that seem fairuite trueot quitot from Conrad anot quitot froan that probably you gentlemen young people never heard oan called Thomas Beer.
You—you probably know the name.I know the name Thomas Beer in connection witritical work.
Did he write The Mauve Decadee wrote the—yes.Yes that's hoot to—  Anot quitot from him.
It was to me a—a good tooood—good methoood usage—usage of words approach to—to an incidenthink the writer as I've said before is completely amoral.
He takes whatever he needs wherever he needs and he does that openly and honestly because he himself hopes that what he does will be good enough so that after him people will take from him and they are welcome to take from him as he feels that he would be welcome by the best of his predecessors to take what they had done.
Yes sir.
do you think the writer is asking for trouble if he attempts to write of things beyond his personal experienceo sio noto not.
There should be no limits to what the writer tries to write about.
He has got to tell it in terms that he does know.
That is he can write about what is beyond his experience but the only terms he does know are within his—his experience his observation.
But there should be no limits to what he attempts.
The—the higher the aim the better.
If he wants to bailure well let him bine bust not jusetty little one.Sir back to your writinften it seemed to me that you choose questions and then answer them yourself as you develop your story rather than letting the reader answer them letting them to go unanswered.
Is thaack of confidence in your reading audience or merelrick of stylet—it's noonscious trick and I—I'm sorry that that word occurred to anyone about it.
It—it's the—the—the desire to—to exhaust completely the—the human character which one is trying to create to probe and to probe and to probe to never be quite satisfied.
The man with judgment will have enough of it that after he has probed and probed to get the—the absolute essence to have the taste and the judgment to edit it then to throw awaot of it but sometimes he doesn't always do that.
It may be lack of taste.
It may be his hurry.
It may be that he himself thinks that this is necessary so that who reads it can follow him that he has probed and probed and probed to get to the absolute bottom of the character he's trying to createon't believe that—that I've ever used that arickay have.
It's—it's hard to say.
Aay the writer is amoral about other people's work and quite often about himself.
He iongenital liar or he wouldn't briter  and maybe he can't tell the truth about anything.
Yes sir.This is sort of long question.
In last week's issue of the New York Times Book Review Colin Wilson discussed the great—makings oreat writer and he said writers today are of two kinds what he termed telescopic and microscopic the telescopic writer being one that giveird's eye an extended view of nature and the microscopic writer being one who examines the life of ordinary people.
He went on to say thareat writer combines these two qualities and examines himself at the same time and finally he said that your writing and that of Dos Passos Williams and Miller were all microscopic and he went on to say third rate.
My question is do you agree with his statements of the makings oreat writer and if not what do you think makereat writer think the—the question about telescopic writing and microscopic writing that'iterary question and is in  Wilson's provenance but probably not in the provenance oriter unless that writer is—is also literaryon't think that you have to be literary just to briter.I want to set the record straighton't think you quoted him quite exactly Josephhink he said people who imitated those writings were third-rate writershink that Colin Wilson seemery brash person buon't think he's inclined to be that brash do you?
Nohink it's the imitators he's thinking of.
Well that is—resembles something that we just spoke about is that someone who hasn't got anything to say he knows if he has the—the desire to write will imitate for the sake of imitation.
He will think Hemingway has written good books so I'll write like Hemingway which is the third-rate writer in the sense that he hasn't gotten something first-rate to say and probably never will have.
Actuallhought at one time that—that what one needed to write with is talent buhink now it's probably patience to—to probe and to try and to probe and to try then ruthlessness to discard what is—is not necessary or what is trashy but mostly what you need is insight which is the probing that you don't need to havelescopic eye noicroscopic eye.
It's—it's insight the desire to see why man does what he doesYes sir.In doing that do you find that you've done it yourselfh yes.
That's—that's like we spoke of—of one has got to—to—to write in the terms that he knows which is his own environment and—and man's closest environment is his—himself.
That he has got to measure everything against what he believes and feels to be true.
Now his belief has—has come from observation from experience from what he has read mostlot from what he's read but he—yes he's got to measure everything against what he himself believes not thinks up here but believes here to be—be true and be moving.
Yes sir.ot of people have said that your novels and short stories contain many hidden meanings and subtle symbolisms and things like that.
Do you find that they more or less as you—as you write do they all fit some preconceived design of yours or the symbolism or the hidden meanings more or less develop as you write or do you find that people sometimes read more into your stories than you yourself originally intended for them to read wouldn't say that they do.
They—they read into my stories lots of things whicyself didn't know were there but I'm sure that they're quite right when they can find symbolism.
The—the symbolism the—the pattern of symbolism iart of—of the man the individual too and he's still writing in terms of his environment and that's part of his environment.
The—the religious symbolism the—the mythological symbolism the rest of it is all that he has robbed and reft and stolen as he read and grew up and listened and he's still writing in the terms which he knows because it simplifies things.
Yes sir.
could you tell me what do you think that Conrad was trying to say or what he means to you as an authores.
What they all mean to me is to—to write about man in conflict with himself his own heart or with his fellows or with his environmenthink that—that the writer that is trying to deliver some sociological or some topical message is—is in retrograde toward the second rate that primarily the writer is writing about people in conflict and the social message is incidental.
The social message is part of the environment which he uses aool.
Yes sir.Sir speaking of symbolism in your story "That Evening Sun" why did you name that fellow Jesushat was probableliberate intent to shock jusittle.
That's a—it'alid name among Negroes in—in Mississippi.
That is you don't see it too often but it's—it's nothing unusual.
It's not uncommon.
But there may have beeittle not so much to shock but to emphasize the poinas making which was that this—this Negro woman who had given devotion to the white family knew that when—when the crisis of her need came the white family wouldn't be there.
Yes sir.How serious were you in the preface to Sanctuary when you said that you were writing for—to the reader instead for yourself as you had in your other booksell that'ong storyrote Sanctuaryeeded money badly at that time and shought of the most horrific storould and wrote itent it to the publisher and he said "Good God we can't print this.
We'd both be iail."
Anas glad of it because by that timad goob and didn't need the money anrote two other books.
They were printed and then one daot the galley for Sanctuary anooked at it anidn't need the money by that time and it was a—a base shoddy shabby job and srote the publisher to throw the whole thing out that—that we wouldn't print it and he—he wrote me back that plates had been made.
He didn't have much money at that time either.
He had money invested in this and something must be done anaid "Well I'll rewrite it then and make it—do the besan to make it a—a decent honest book."
And he said "Well all right.
I'll agree to that and I'll pay half the cost of the new plates and you pay half."
Sad to get another job to earn the two hundred and seventy dollars to pay my share of the new plates anewrote the book and did the besould with it to make it—make it an honest book anas still ashamed of that first attempt because that was the only timver betrayed—well call it the muse you might say anas so ashamed of it and wherote that—that prefactill didn't like the book antill am sorry tharote the first version of it and that was the reason for the preface.When did you first realize that you wanted to write sir thinad scribbled all my life ever sincearned to readrote poetry wheaoung man untiound that I—that it was bad poetry would never be first rate poetry.
Anas—I was in New Orleans.
I—I worked foootlegger.
This was in '20—'21 '22 '23aaunch from New Orleans across Pontchartrain down in the Industrial Canal out into the Gulf where the schooner from Cuba would bring the raw alcohol and bury it oand-spit and we'd dig it up and bring it back to the bootlegger and—and his mother  she was—she was an Italian.
She waice little old lady and—and she was the expert.
She would turn it into—to scotch witittle creosote  and bourbon.
We had the—the labels the bottles everything.
It was quite a—quitusiness.
Anet Sherwood Anderson.
He was living there aniked him right off and we would—we got along fine together.
We would meet in the evenings in the afternoons.
We'd walk and he'd talk and I'd listen.
We'd meet in the evenings and we'd go trinking place and we'd sit around till one or two o'clock drinking and still me listening and him talking.
Then in the morning he would be in seclusion working and the next time I'd see him the same thing we would spend the afternoon and evening together the next morning he'd be working.
Anhought then if that was the life it took to briter that was the life for me.
So—srotook and whetarteound that writing was fun anadn't seen  Anderson in some time tilenderson on the street.
She said "We haven't seen you iong time.
What's wrong said "I'm writinook."
And she said "Do you want Sherwood to look at itnaid "No'm it's not finished yet.adn't thought of anybody looking at it.
It was fun to write the book.
Anaw her later and she said "I told Sherwood you were writinook and he said 'Good God.'
Then he said  that he—he will makrade with you.
If he don't have to read it he will tell his publisher to take it.aid "Done."
And so that was how my first book got published and by that time I'd found that writing was funiked it.
That was my cup of tea and I've been at it ever since and will probably stick at it.
Yes sir.Sir what gave you the idea for your short story "Mountain Victory"t—I believe aemember that came from the—the idea of the—let me seeelieve it was the idea of the irreconcilable difference between two men of more or the less the same background the—the eastern Tennessee mountain man who waoutherner too and the—the descendant olave-owning aristocracy to meet in those conditions never to—to be—be kin yet never to touch.
Iay both victims of the war.
Probably that's what it came fromon't rememberas still writing about people and aecall that would—might've beenust don't know.
so much—so much of your material seems to be connected.
Is there any way you determine what is short story material and what is novel materialo the—the story itself does thatever know myself which it's going to be.
The Sound and the Furhought was going to bhort storyhink it would takuch better craftsman thaore trained craftsman maybore literary craftsman to know beforehand what form the material wants to take.
I'm simply writing about people that I—I begin whean and stop as soon aan.I remember asking youestion the other day about two stories one called "Two Soldierstory thaike very much and some of the people in my class have read and whaonsideequel to that story called "The Country Will—She Shall Survive.hink that's it's it or—  Oh "Shall Not Perish.
""Shall Not Perish."
That's it.
It seems to me that there'ifference between the two stories iay.
The first storan read over and over again witreat deal of pleasure and interest.
The second story seems to me to be something oead thing in comparison to the first anhink you started to tell me the other day wheas speaking of it the first story had to do with people's character and the second story really had to do with an idea.
That's right.
The—the first story had to do with one of the most interesting of all conflicts all human conflicts.
To me it's—it's the boy trying to—to reconcile to—to learn in order to accept the adult world he will have to cope with anelieved more in the story about the—the little boy and his brother who got drafted thaelieved in the—in the idea tharied to make into another story the sequel to it.Do you feel that's why the second story may not seem as—  That's right.
That I'm simply not an idea man.Yes.
As I'm not—not really interested enough in ideas to take even my own too seriously.
Yes sir.
from what viewpoint did you write the—you write the story from—I believe it was from These Thirteen—it was called "Carcassonne" or "Carcassonne"hat was—I was still writing about a—a young man in conflict with his environment.
I—it seemed to me that—that fantasy was the best way to tell that story.
To have told it in terms of—of simple realism would have lost something in my opinion.
To use fantasy was—was the best and that's a—a piece that I've always liked because there was—was the poet again.
I—I wanted to boet and I—I think of myself now aailed poet not aovelist at all buailed poet who had to take up what he could do.
Yes sir.Sir in connection with that there's an old French poem by the name of "Carcassonne.orget the author.
It has pretty much the general the same sort of themeonder if that was in your mind at the time.on't know the poem though if—iid know it anad needed to steal from it I'm surouldouldn't have hesitated.
What do you mean your story "All the Dead Pilots" anelievtory called "Honor" in which you give the impression that those people who fought in the war after those experiences of war will be dead the rest of their livesell in a—iay they were.
That the—the ones that—that even continued to live very long were the exceptions and the one among them that coped with the—the change of time or—you can count them on your thumbs almost.
Rickenbacker's one but there are not too many others.
Bishop he finally drank himself to death died last year and the others Victor Yeats didn't live ten years.
But then iay they—they—they were dead they had exhausted themselves psychically whatever it was but anyway they were unfitted for the world that they found afterwards.
Not that they rejected they simply were unfitted.
They had worn themselves out.You'd restrict that feeling to people who had been in aviation not with people who had served in other branches of the armed servicest that time yes because there was more concentration of being frightened of flying then than in infantry or—or ground troops.
You just got—got scared worse quicker and more often—Yes.
Flying than you did on the ground.
Yes sir.You seem to distinguish between literary men and—and writing menas wondering if you would elaborate on that.
Are not the two reconcilable?
Cannot they bees I—I thinaid that—that some writing men are literary men but I—I don't think that you have to biterary man to briterhink that—that to biterary man inferertain amount of—of well even formal education and there are some writers that have never had formal education.
Of course you can be literary without the formal education but I've—I've got to talk in terms of whanow about  now you see and Sherwood Anderson that we were not literary men in the sense that—that Edmund Wilson iiterary man or Malcolm Cowley for instanceSorry.
what short-story writers at the present time do you find interesting people from the point of view of their—of their stories something that people might read with profitaave that again?
What short story writers do you admire at the present timeow that'ifficult question for me becaushink not of writers but of the charactersemember the characters they wrote about without being able to remember always just—just who wrote the—wrote the piece.
But wheaoung man Thomas Beer thaentioned he influenced mot.
Chekhovan't think of some of the others.What about the present writers in your area of the countrriter like Eudora Weltyelhink again of—of the books rather than the writer.Yes.hink oook of hers called The Robber Bridegroom which was quite different from any of the other things she has done which to me was—was the—the worthwhile onehink of—of stories of—of Hemingwayouldn't say thaike all of Hemingway buemember stories of his that—that haven't been matched in my time thougan think of—of people that have written better—better pages better paragraphs than Hemingwayan think of—of stories of—of Erskine Caldwellave always rated Thomas Wolfe first among my lot because of—of the failure the splendor of his failure as compared to the not quite splendor of—of our failures buould never read Wolfe again.
It would—it's still a—a—a magnificent failure buould never read it again anemember very little of whaid read from Wolfe buemember characters from Hemingwayemember characters from Caldwell but not from Wolfe.Did you want to asuestion ...?
What importance do you attach to the titles of your stories and books and how do you go about selecting them thinitle is extremely important took anhink that—that a—a gift for choosing titles iark of genius.
audience laughtehink that—that Balzac the—the—the way he chose titles that was genius and I've been—been quite lucky in the titles I've chosen but some of them have been wrong.
But—but most of them have been pretty good titlehink.
Yes sir.
when you set out to writook do you usually know how you're going to reconcile your characters in the end or how the plot is going to work out or do you let this work itself out for itself as you go alongfter about the third or fourth page the characters take charge of that book.
They write the rest of it.
They just tell me what to put down.
... you hauestion.It was almost the same question but what happens—do you ever feel the characters particularly one—do you feeecessity to give every character .... do you tell all the truth about that character that you feel needs to be told regardless of whether ...hink that—that after about ten bookad learned enough of—of judgment to wherould pick and choose the—the facet oharacter whiceed at that particular time to move the storas telling so thaan—can takacet of one character in one story and—and another facet of that character in another story.
To me it's the same character though sometimes to the reader it may seem as though the character had changed or had developed more.
To me he hasn't.
Thased my editorial prerogative of choosing whaeeded from that particular character at that particular time.In light of that when you think about the failure of Thomas Wolfe do you feel that there is any connection with ... the necessity ... the way you feel about how characters ...nderstand it right I'm sure that Wolfe felt the same way thaid about his editorial right to—to choose what he wanted from the character in order to tell what he was trying to tell.
To—to me whaean by the—the splendor of Wolfe's failure is that—that every man will—will live onlhort time his biblical three score and ten.
He knows that that in time soon very soon or comparably he will be gone finished and done and his only chance iery limited one—limited one in which to—to express all living or earth anguish or hope aspiration has meant to him is in the short space he will have and he is iay trying to—to write the whole history of the human heart on the head oin.
He'll have only one shot at it and that's whaean by the splendor of Wolfe's failure that he tried hardest with the most courage to put the whole history of man's heart on the head of the pin.And that was your ambition—  Yes.
how much do you feel that the writer's being involved with people in his writing is dependent upon his being actively involved with real people in the real world think that has nothing to do with the writing.
That he can be involved with people he can be involved with alcohol or with gambling or anything and it's not going to affect the writer.
Noave no patience anon't hold with the mute inglorious Miltonshink if—if he's demon-driven with something to be said then he's going to write it.
He can—can blame his—the fact that he's not turning out the work on lots of things.
I've heard people say "Well iere not married and—and had childreould briter."
I've heard people say "Iould just stop doing thiould briter.on't believe thathink if you're going to write you're going to write and nothing will stop you.
That you can be involved and probably the more you're involved it may be better for you.
That maybe it's—it's bad to—to crawl off into the ivory tower and stay there that maybe you do need to be involved to get the edges beaten off of yoittle every day may be good for the writerYes sir.In the story "Red Leaves" the slave escapes from his Indian captors and goes and hides in the swamp and in order to avert his capture has the cottonmouth strike him in the arm.
Then the Indians come and capture him anyway.
And why did this happen in the story?
Is this to show that man can't escape his condition or—o that was—the snake episode was to show—to show that—that man when he knows he's going to die thinks that he can accept death but he doesn't he doesn't really.
The Negro at the time he—he said I'm already dead it doesn't matter the snake can bite me because I'm already dead but yet at the end he still wanted to put off—that—that man will cling to life that ireference between grief and nothing man will take grief always.
...
Yes sir.
in the next to last chapter of Light in August you have the scene where Hightower is considering many things his past life in particular and there is the vision that he sees of the dead face of the dead Christmas and as he sees it it begins struggling trying to resolve itself intifferent focus and whilhinnow what that scene means to me would you care to comment on your meaning therees he waan of God who had—had failed always.
He in—his belief was that he had failed his wife that if—if he had been different his wife wouldn't have gone bad that here was—waime whean of courage would've saved this man and he the man of God failed again and so he resorted into fantasy to dream when—when some Hightower was brave and gallant and courageous.
That it was escape that he hated himself.I have often wondered did you mean in that scene that he is approaching death .... Is he sufferineart attack there ... that he is dying in that chaptero.
No he wished he could die.
No he didn't.
He would have to suffeittle longer than that.
Yes sir.Many writers beginning to write usually in their first work make one of their characters usually the hero an image of himself.
Noon't find this true in—in your writings at all.
But mask you do you ever find yourself identifying with one of your characters and have to resist for instance someone like Gavin Stevens or just for the moment say the—the old man in the last pages oable who comes out of the crowd don't know whether anyone could say any writer could say just how much he identifies himself with his characters.
Quite often the young man will write about himself simply because himself is what he knows best.
That he is using himself as the standard of measure and to simplify things he writes about himself as—perhaps as he presumes himself to be maybe as he hopes himself to be or maybe as he hates himself for being.
Though after that the more—the more you write the—the more you—you see you have to write the more you have learned by writing and probably you don't really have time to identify yourself witharacter except at certain moments when the character is iosition to—to express truthfully things which you yourself believe to be true.
Then you'll put your own ideas in his mouth but they—when you do that they'll become hishink that you're not trying to—to preach through the character that you're too busy writing about people.
It just happens that this man agrees with you on this particular point and so he says it.
Yes sir.
you seem to say that a—a writer should write of the heart and I'm assuming that also—this is an assumption—that you believe thariter should write from the heart.
Now as opposed to writing from the—of the heart there's writing of the glands which you've mentioned before.
Mariter successfully write from the glands rather than from the hearte can successfully do it like—what's his name?
and the toughs theme.
But it's not—it's not good writing.
It's not worth doing in my opinion.
It's successful but it ain't worth doing.
I—whaeant to write from the heart is it's—it's the heart that—that has the— the desire to be better than man is the—the—the up here can know the—the distinction between good and evil but it's the heart that makes you want to be better than you are.
That's whaean by to write it from the heart.
That it's the—the heart that makes you want to be brave when you are afraid that you might boward that wants you—wants you to be generous or wants you to—to be compassionate when you think that maybe you won'think that—that the intellect it might say "Well which is the most profitable?
Shale compassionate or shale uncompassionate?
Which is most profitable?
Which is the most profitable?
Shale brave or notut the heart wants always to be better than man is.
Yes sir.Was the "Rose for Emily" an idea oharacter?
Just how did you go about that—hat came from a—froicture of the strand of hair on the pillow.
It wahost story.
Simplicture otrand of hair on the pillow in the abandoned house.
you seem to find the easiest message for writing aind of easy first-person with his message or something of that sort.
You're always there in your stories is my hunch.
Yes.That's the easiest simplest method of doing it.
Yes.Is that how you started out in your first stories from that point of viewoas still trying to—to talk about people in the simplest waould think of anyself probably never did decide Now shall this be told in the first person or the third person or howas simply talking about—trying to tell about people trying to create a—a man which would have the solidity of—oiving man that is would be capable of anguish and—and courage and compassion or baseness be human so that he too would throhadow behind him noransparency that the others are just a—a matter of which tool to use.
It's—it's not—not too important.
Yes sir.
you say you're interested in and have been throughout your writing in people rather than ideas.
I'm just wondering as you were saying that about for examplook like the Fable at what point did the allegory—did you become conscious of it?
Obviously you didn't take the idea and impose iather from what you say.
What got you into the Fable what—what—  That was tour de force.
It—the notion occurred to me one day in 1940—'42 shortly after Pearl Harbor and the beginning of the—the last great war.
Suppose—who might that unknown soldier be?
Suppose that had been Christ again under that fine big cenotaph with the eternal flame burning on it?
That he would naturally have got crucified again anad to—then it became tour de force becausad to invent enough stuff to carry this notion.You were writing from an idea thenhat's right that was an idea anope that—an unexpressed thought that Christ had appeared twice had been crucified twice and maybe we'd have only one more chance.
Yes.As you started ... had you ever reaook called The Paths of Gloryes....  Well that was—his book too was based on an actual instance in the French records.
There waegiment that—that refused and also that book I—I did use—when it became tour de forcad to use all the symbolisould think of anas using the—the trinity of—of man's—of man's spirit the—the one the—the—the young British pilot who said "This is evilon't accept itill decline the world beforill accept it."
The old general who said "This is evil but we can bear it."
The runner who said "This is evil I'm going to do something about it.
"They have—anyone have any one more question you want to ask because we'll have to stop pretty soon.
We got classes coming on.
Anybody want to asuestionthank you very much for coming into this classroom.
It's been very nice indeed having you.
Thank you.
Thank you gentlemen.Welcome.
There's nothing to be said here tonight except thaill reaelection from the "Spotted Horses."
Sir.
an see now this is going to becomery bad habit with me to stand up like this witot of nice people that don't dare say "Shut up and sit down."
This is about the horses.
When the Texan picking his teeth witplintered kitchen match emerged from the house twenty minutes later the tethered wagons and riding horses and mules extended from the lot gate to Varner's store and there were more than fifty men now standing along the fence beside the gate watching him quietlittle covertly as he approached rollinittle slightly bowlegged the high heels of his carved boots printing neatly into the dust.
"Morning gents" he said.
"Here bud" he said to the little boy who stood slightly behind him looking at the protruding butt of the pistol.
He toooin from his pocket and gave it to the boy.
"Run to the store and get mox of gingersnaps."
He looked about at the quiet faces protuberant sucking his teeth.
He rolled the match from one side of his mouth to the other without touching it.
"You boys done made your picks have you?
Ready to start her off hahhey didn't answer.
They were not looking at him now.
That is he began to have the feeling that each face had stopped looking at him the second before his gaze reached it.
Afteoment Freeman said "Aint you going to gap in tape wait for Flem"Whyhe Texan said.
Then Freeman stopped looking at him too.
There was nothing in Freeman's face either.
There was nothing no alteration in the Texan's voice.
"Eck you done already picked out yours.
So we can start her off when you are ready."
"I reckon not" Eck said.
"I wouldn't buy nothinas afraid to walk up to and touch."
"Them little ponieshe Texan said.
"You helped water and feed themet that boy of yours could walk up to any one of them."
"He better not let me catch him at it" Eck said.
The Texan looked at the quiet faces his gaze at once abstract and alert with an impenetrable surface quality like flint as though the surface were impervious or perhaps there was nothing behind it.
"Them ponies is gentle aove boys.
The man that buys them will get the best piece of horseflesh he ever forked or druv for the money.
Naturally they got spiritint selling crowbait.
Besides who'd want Texas crowbait anyway with Mississippi full of itudience laughter His stare was still absent and unwinking; there was no mirth or humor in his voice and there was neither mirth nor humor in the single guffaw which came from the rear of the group.
Two wagons were now drawing out of the road at the same time up to the fence.
The men got down from them and tied them to the fence and approached.
"Come up boys" the Texan said.
"You're just in time to buood gentle horse cheap."
"How about that one that cut your vest off night before last voice said.
This time three or four guffawed.
The Texan looked toward the sound bleak and unwinking.
"What about ite said.
The laughter if it had been laughter ceased.
The Texan turned to the nearest gatepost and climbed to the top of it his alternate thighs deliberate and bulging in his tight trousers the butt of the pistol catching and losing the sun in pearly gleams.
Sitting on the post he looked down at the faces along the fence which were attentive grave reserved and not looking at him.
"All right" he said.
"Who's going to start her off witid?
Step right up; take your pick and make your bid and when the last one is sold walk in that lot and put your rope on the best piece of horseflesh you ever forked or druv for the money.
There ainony there that aint worth fifteen dollars.
Young sound good for saddle or work stock guaranteed to outlast four ordinary horses; you couldn't kill one of them witxle-tree—" There wamall violent commotion at the rear of the group.
The little boy appeared burrowing among the motionless overalls.
He approached the post the new and unbroken paper carton lifted.
The Texan leaned down and took it and tore the end from it and shook three or four of the cakes onto the boy's handand as small and almost as black as that ooon.
He held the carton in his hand while he talked pointing out the horses with it as he indicated them.
"Look at that one with the three stocking-feet and the frost-bit ear; watch him now when they pass again.
Look at that shoulder-action; that horse is worth twenty dollars of any man's money.
Who'll make mid on him to start her offis voice was harsh ready forensic.
Along the fence below him the men stood with button close tp their overalls the tobacco-sacks and worn purses the sparse silver and frayed bills hoardeoin aime in the cracks of chimneys or chinked into the logs of walls.
From time to time the horses broke and rushed with purposeless violence and huddled again watching the faces along the fence with wild mismatched eyes.
The lane was full of wagons now.
As the others arrived they would have to stop in the road beyond it and the occupants came up the lane on foot.
Littlejohn came out of her kitchen.
She crossed the yard looking toward the lot gate.
There walackened wash pot set on four bricks in the corner of the yard.
She builire beneath the pot and came to the fence and stood there foime her hands on her hips and the smoke from the fire drifting blue and slow behind her.
Then she turned and went back into the house.
"Come on boys" the Texan said.
"Who'll make mid"Four bitsoice said.
The Texan didn't even glance toward it.
"Or if he dont suit you how about that fiddle-head horse without no mane to speak of?
Foaddle pony I'd rather have him than this stocking-footeard somebody say fifty cents just noweckon he meant five dollars didn't he?
Dear five dollarsFour bits for the lot" the same voice said.
This time there were no guffaws.
It was the Texan who laughed harshly with only his lower face as if he were recitinultiplication table.
"Fifty cents for the dried mud offen them horses he means" he said.
"Who'll givollar more for the genuine Texas cockle-burrsLittlejohn came out of the kitchen carrying the sawn half—half oooden hogshead which she set otump beside the smoking pot and stood with her hands on her hips looking into the lot fohile without coming to the fence this time.
Then she went back into the house.
"What's the matter with you boyshe Texan said.
"Here Eck you have been helping me and you know them horses.
How about making mid on that wall-eyed one you picked out last night?
Here.
Waiinute."
He thrust the paper carton into his other hip pocket and swung his feet inward and dropped cat-light into the lot.
The ponies huddled watched him.
Then they broke before him and slid stiffly along the fence.
He turned them and they whirled and rushed back across the lot; whereupon as though he had been waiting his chance when they should have turned their backs on him the Texan began to run too so that when they reached the opposite side of the lot and turned slowing to huddle again he was almost upon him—upon them.
The earth became thunderous; dust arose out of which the animals began to burst like flushed quail and into which with that apparent unflagging faith in his own invulnerability the Texan rushed.
For an instant the watchers could see them in the dust—the pony backed into the angle of the fence and the stable the man facing it reaching toward his hip.
Then the beast rushed at him iort of fatal and hopeless desperation and he struck it between the eyes with the pistol-butt and felled it and leaped upon its prone head.
The pony recovered almost at once and pawed itself to its knees and heaved at its prisoned head and fought itself up dragging the man with it; for an instant in the dust the watchers saw the man free of the earth and in violent lateral motion likag attached to the horse's head.
Then the Texan's feet came back to earth and the dust blew aside and revealed them motionless the Texan's sharp heels braced into the ground one hand gripping the pony's forelock and the other its nostrils the long evil muzzle wrung backward over its scarred shoulder while it breathed in labored and hollow groansittlejohn was in the yard again.
No one had seen her emerge this time.
She carried an armful of clothing anetal-ridged washboard and she was standing motionless at the kitchen steps looking into the lot.
Then she moved across the yard still looking into the lot and dumped the garments into the tub still looking into the lot.
"Look him over boys" the Texan panted turning his own suffused face and the protuberant glare of his eyes toward the fence.
"Look him over quick.
Them shoulders and—" He had relaxed for an instant apparently.
The animal exploded again; again for an instant the Texan was free to the earth though he was still talking "—and legs you whoa I'll tear your face right look him over quick boys worth fifteen dollars of let me geolt of who'll make mid whoa you blare-eyed jack rabbit whoa!"
They were moving now—a kaleidoscope of inextricable and incredible violence on the periphery of which the metal clasps of the Texan's suspenders sun-glinted in ceaseless orbit with terrific slowness across the lot.
Then the broad clay-colored hat soared deliberately outward; an instant later the Texan followed it though still on his feet and the pony shot free in mad staglike bounds.
The Texan picked up the hat and struck the dust from it against his leg and returned to the fence and mounted the post again.
He was breathing heavily.
Still the faces didn't look at him as he took the carton from his hip and shooake from it and put the cake into his mouth chewing breathing harshly.
Littlejohn turned away and began to bail water from the pot into the tub though after each bucketful she turned her head and looked into the lot again.
"Now boys" the Texan said.
"Who says that pony aint worth fifteen dollars?
You couldn't buy that much dynamite for just fifteen dollars.
There ainne of them cant dile in three minutes; turn them into pasture and they will board themselves; work them like hell all day and every time you think about it lay them over the head witingle-tree and afteouple of days every jack rabbit one of them will be as tame—so tame you will have to put them out of the house at night likat."
He shook another cake from the carton and ate it.
"Come on Eck" he said.
"Start her off.
How about ten dollars for that horse Eck"What neeot foorsouldn't—I would neeear-trap to catchck said.
"Didn't you just see me catch himI seen you" Eck said.
"Anont want nothing as big aorse iot to wrastle with it every time it finds me on the same side oence it's on."
"All right" the Texan said.
He was still breathing harshly but now there was nothing of fatigue or breathlessness in it.
He shook another cake into his palm and inserted it beneath the moustache.
"All rightant to get this auction startedint come here to live no matter how gooountry you folks claim you got.
I'm going to give you that horse."
Fooment there was no sound not even that of breathing except the Texan's.
"You going to give it to meck said.
"Yes.
Provided you will start the bidding on the next one."
Again there was no sound save the Texan's breathing and then the clash of  Littlejohn's pail against the rim of the pot.
"I just start the bidding" Eck said.
"I dont have to buy it lesseint over-topped."
Another wagon had come up to the lane.
It was battered and paintless.
One wheel had been repaired by crossed planks bound to the spokes with baling wire and the two underfed mules worattered harness patched with bits of cotton rope; the reins were ordinary cotton plow-lines not new.
It containeoman ihapeless gray garment anaded sunbonnet anan in faded and patched though clean overalls.
There was not room for the wagon to draw out of the lane so the man left it standing where it was and got down and came forward—a thin man not large with something about his eyes something strained and washed-out at once vague and intense who shoved into the crowd at the rear saying "What?
What's that?
Did he give him that horseAll right" the Texan said.
"That wall-eyed horse with the scarred neck belongs to you.
Now.
That one that looks like he's had his—had his head ilour barrel.
What do you say?
Ten dollars"Did he give him that horse—did he give him that horsehe newcomer said.
"A dollar" Eck said.
The Texan's mouth was still open for speech; for an instant his face died so behind his hard eyes.
"A dollare said.
"One dollar?
Dictually hear thatDurn it" Eck said.
"Two dollars then.
Buint—" "Wait" the newcomer said.
"You up there on the post."
The Texan looked at him.
When the others turned they saw that the woman had left the wagon too though they had not known she was there until—since they had not seen the wagon drive up.
She came among them behind the man gaunt in the gray shapeless garment and the sunbonnet wearing stained canvas gymnasium shoes.
She overtook the man but she did not touch him standing just behind him her hands rolled before her into the gray dress.
"Henry" she said ilat voice.
The man looked over his shoulder.
"Get back to that wagon" he said.
"Here missus" the Texan said.
"Henry's going to get the bargain of his life in abouinute.
Here boys let the missus come up close where she can see.
Henry's going to pick out that saddle-horse the missus been wanting.
Who says ten—"  "Henry" the woman said.
She didn't raise her voice.
She had not once looked at the Texan.
She touched the man's arm.
He turned and struck her hand down.
"Get back to that wagon likold you."
The woman stood behind him her hands rolled again into her dress.
She was not looking at anything speaking to anyone.
"He aint no more despair than to buy one of them things" she said.
"And us not but five dollars away from the poorhouse he aint no more despair."
The man turned upon her with that curious air of leashed of dreamlike fury.
The others lounged along the fence in attitudes gravely inattentive almost oblivious.
Littlejohn had been washing for some time now pumping rhythmically up and down above the washboard in the sud-foamed tub.
Now she stood erect again her soap-raw hands on her hips looking into the lot.
"Shut your mouth and get back to that wagon" the man said.
"Do you want me to takagon stake to youe turned and looked up at the Texan.
"Did you give him that horsee said.
The Texan was looking at the woman.
Then he looked at the man; still watching him he tilted the paper carton over his open palmingle cake came out of it.
"Yes" he said.
"Is the fellow that bids in to this next horse going to get that first one tooNo" the Texan said.
"All right" the other said.
"Are you going to givorse to the man that makes the first bid on the next oneNo" the Texan said.
"Then if you was just starting the auction by giving awaorse why didn't you wait till we were all herehe Texan stopped looking at the other.
He raised the empty carton and squinted carefully into it as if it might contairecious jewel or perhapeadly insect.
Then he crumpled it and dropped it carefully beside the post on which he sat.
"Eck bids two dollars" he said.
"I believe he still thinks he's bidding on them scraps of bob-wire they come here in instead of one of them horses.
Buot to accept it.
But are you boys—" "So Eck's going to get two horses aollaead" the newcomer said.
"Three dollars."
The woman touched him again.
He flung her hand off without turning and she stood again her hands rolled into her dress across her flat stomach not looking at anything.
"Mister" she said "we got chaps in the house that never had shoes last winter.
We aint got corn to feed the stock.
We got five dollararned weaving by firelight after dark.
And he aint no more despair."
"Henry bids three dollars" the Texan said.
"Raise hiollar Eck and the horse is yours."
Beyond the fence the horses rushed suddenly and for no reason and as suddenly stopped staring at the faces along the fence.
"Henry" the woman said.
The man was watching Eck.
His stained and broken teeth showeittle beneath his lip.
His wrists dangled into fists below the faded sleeves of his shirt too short from—from many washings.
"Four dollars" Eck said.
"Five dollars!"
the husband said raising one clenched hand.
He shouldered himself forward toward the gatepost.
The woman didn't follow him.
She now looked at the Texan for the first time.
Her eyes werashed gray also as though they had faded too like the dress and the sunbonnet.
"Mister" she said "if you take that five dollararned my chaps a-weaving for one of them things it'll burse on you and yours during all the time of man."
"Five dollars!"
the husband shouted.
He thrust himself up to the post his clenched hand oevel with the Texan's knees.
He opened it upoad of frayed banknotes and silver.
"Five dollars!
And the man that raises it will have to beat my head off or I'll beat hisn."
"All right" the Texan said.
"Five dollars is bid.
But dont you shake your hand at me."
At five oclock that—that afternoon the Texan crumpled the third paper carton and dropped it to the earth beneath him.
In the copper slant of the leveling sun which fell also upon the line of limp garments in  Littlejohn's back yard and which cast his shadow and that of the post on which he sat long across the lot where now and then the ponies still rushed in purposeless and tireless surges the Texan straightened his leg and thrust his hand into his pocket and took ouoin and leaned down to the little boy.
His voice was now hoarse spent.
"Here bud" he said.
"Run to the store and get mox of gingersnaps."
The men still stood along the fence tireless in their overalls and faded shirts.
Flem Snopes was there now appeared—appeared suddenly from nowhere standing beside the fence witpace the width of three or four men on either side of him standing there in his small yet definite isolation chewing tobacco in the same gray trousers and minute bow tie in which he had departed last summer but iew cap gray too like the other but new and overlaid witright golfer's plaid looking also at the horses in the lot.
All of them two—save two had been sold for sums ranging from three dollars analf to eleven and twelve dollars.
The purchasers as they had bid them in had gathered as though by instinct inteparate group on the other side of the gate where they stood with their hands lying upon the top strand of the fence watching wittill more sober intensity the animals which some of them had owned for seven or eight hours now but had not yet laid hands upon.
The husband Henry stood beside the post on which the Texan sat.
The wife had gone back to the wagon where she sat gray in the gray garment motionless looking at nothing still; she might have been something inanimate which he had loaded onto the wagon to move it somewhere waiting now in the wagon until he should be ready to go on again patient insensate timeless.
"I boughorse anaid cash for it" he said.
His voice was harsh and spent too the mad look in his eyes had—hauality glazed now and even sightless.
"And yet you expect me to stand around here till they are all sold beforan get my horse.
Well you can do all the expecting you want.
I'm going to take my horse out of there and go home."
The Texan looked down at him.
The Texan's shirt was blotched with sweat.
His big face was cold and still his voice level.
"Take your horse then."
Afteoment Henry looked away.
He stood with his head benittle swallowing from time to time.
"Aint you going to catch him for meIt aint my horse" the Texan said in that flat still voice.
Aftehile Henry raised his head.
He didn't look at the Texan.
"Who'll help me catch my horsee said.
Nobody answered.
They stood along the fence looking quietly into the lot where the ponies huddled already beginning to fadittle where the long shadow of the house lay upon them deepening.
From  Littlejohn's kitchen the smell of frying ham cameoisy cloud of sparrows swept across the lot and inthinaberry tree beside the house and in the high soft vague blue swallows stooped and swirled in erratic indecision their cries like strings plucked at random.
Without looking back Henry raised his voice "Bring that ere plowline."
Aftehile the wife moved.
She got down from the wagon and toooil of new cotton rope from it and approached.
The husband took the rope from her and moved toward the gate.
The Texan began to descend from the post stiffly as Henry put his hand on the latch.
"Come on here" he said.
His wife had stopped when he took the rope from her.
She moved again obediently her hands rolled into the dress across her stomach passing the Texan without looking at him.
"Dont you go in there missus" he said.
She stopped not looking at him not looking at anything.
The husband opened the gate and entered the lot and turned holding the gate open but without raising his eyes.
"Come on here" he said.
"Dont you go in there missus" the Texan said.
The wife stood motionless between them her face almost concealed by the sunbonnet her hands folded across her stomach.
"I reckoetter" she said.
The old—the other men did not look at her at all at her or Henry either.
They stood along the fence grave and quiet and inattentive almost bemused.
Then the wife passed through the gate; the husband shut it behind them and turned and began to move toward the huddled ponies the wife following in the gray and shapeless garment within which she moved without inference of locomotion like something ooving platforloat.
The horses were watching them.
They clotted and blended and shifted among themselves on the point of breaking though not breaking yet.
The husband shouted at them.
He began to curse them advancing the wife following.
Then the huddle broke the animals moving with high stiff knees circling the two people who turned and followed again as the herd flowed and huddled again at the opposite side of the lot.
"There he is" the husband said.
"Get him into that corner."
The herd divided; the horse which the husband had bought jolted on stiff legs.
The wife shouted at it; it spun and poised plunging then the husband struck it across the face with the coiled rope and it whirled and slammed into the corner of the fence.
"Keep it there now" the husband said.
He shook out the rope advancing.
The horse watched him shouted wild glaring eyes; it rushed again straight toward the wife.
She shouted at it and waved her arms but it soared past her iong bound and rushed again into the huddle of its fellows.
They followed and hemmed it again into the other corner; again the wife failed to stop its rush for freedom and the husband turned and struck her with the coiled rope.
"Why didn't you head hime said.
"Why didn't youe struck her again; she didn't move not even to fend the rope witaised arm.
The men along the fence stood quietly their faces lowered as though brooding upon the earth at their feet.
Only Flem Snopes was still watching—if he ever had been looking into the lot at all standing iittle island of isolation chewing with his characteristic faint sidewise thrust beneath the new plaid cap.
The Texan said something not loud harsh and short.
He entered the lot and went to the husband and jerked the uplifted rope from his hand.
The husband whirled as though he were about to spring at the Texan crouched slightly his knees bent and his arms held slightly away from his sides though his gaze never mounted higher than the Texan's carved and dusty boots.
Then the Texan took the husband by the arm and led him back toward the gate the wife following and through the gate which he held open for the woman and then closed.
He tooad of banknotes from his trousers and removeill from it and put it into the woman's hand.
"Get him into the wagon and get him on home" he said.
"What's that forlem Snopes said.
He had approached.
He now stood beside the post on which the Texan had been sitting.
The Texan didn't look at him.
"Thinks he bought one of them ponies" the Texan said.
He spoke ilat still voice like that oan afteharp run.
"Get him on away missus."
"Give him back that money" the husband said in his lifeless spent tone.
"I bought that horse anim to have him iot to shoot him beforan puope on him."
The Texan did not even look at him.
"Get him on away from here missus" he said.
"You take your money anake my horse" the husband said.
He was shaking slowly and steadily now as though he were cold.
His hands open and shut below the frayed cuffs of his shirt.
"Give it back to him" he said.
"You dont—you dont own no horse of mine" the Texan said.
"Get him on home missus."
The husband raised his spent face his mad glazed eyes.
He reached out his hand.
The woman held the banknote in her folded hands across her stomach.
Fohile the husband's shaking hand merely fumbled at it.
Then he drew the banknote free.
"It's my horse" he said.
"I bought it.
These fellows saw meaid for it.
It's my horse.
Here."
He turned and extended the banknote toward Snopes.
"You got something to do with these horsesought one.
Here's the money for itought one.
Ask him."
Snopes took the banknote.
turning pages They're in the lot again still trying to catch the horses.
This is Eck and the little boy.
"Watch out paw!"
the boy said.
"There he is!
There's ourn!"
It was the one the Texan had given Eck.
"Catch him Paw!"
"Get out of my way" Eck said.
"Get back to that wagon."
The line was still advancing.
The ponies milled clotting forced gradually backward toward the open door of the barn.
Henry was still slightly in front crouched slightly his thin figure even in the mazy moonlight emanating something of that spent fury.
The splotchy huddle of animals seemed to be moving before the advancing line of men liknowball which they might have been pushing before them by some invisible means gradually nearer and nearer to the back—black yawn of the barn door.
Later it was obvious that the ponies were so intent upon the men that they did not realize that the barn was even behind them until they backed into the shadow of it.
Then an indescribable sounovement of desperate and despairing arose among them; for an instant of static horror men and animals faced one another then the men whirled and ran beforaudy vomit of long wild faces and splotched chests which overtook and scattered them and flung them sprawling aside and completely obliterated from sight Henry and the little boy neither of whom had moved though Henry had flung up both arms still holding his coiled rope the herd sweeping on across the lot to crash through the gate which the last man through it had neglected to close leaving it slightly ajar carrying all of the gate save the upright to which the hinges were nailed with them and so among the teams and wagons which choked the lane the teams springing and lunging too snapping hitch-reins and tongues.
Then the whole inextricable mass crashed among the wagons and eddied and divided about the one in which the woman sat and rushed on down the lane and into the road dividing one half going one way and one half the other.
The men in the lot except Henry got to their feet and ran toward the gate.
The little boy once more had not been touched not even thrown off his feet; fohile his father held him clear of the ground in one hand shaking him likag doll.
"Didn'ell you to stay in that wagonck cried.
"Didn'ell youLook out paw!"
the boy chattered out of the violent shaking.
"There's ourn!
There he goes!"
It was the horse the Texan had given them again.
It was as if they owned no other the other one did not exist; as if by some absolute and instantaneous rapport of blood they had relegated to oblivion the one for which they had paid money.
They ran to the gate and down the lane where the other men had disappeared.
They saw the horse the Texan had given them whirl and dash back and rush through the gate into  Littlejohn's yard and run up the front steps and crash once on the wooden veranda and vanish through the front door.
Eck and the boy ran up onto the verandaamp sat oable just inside the door.
In its mellow light they saw the horse fill the long hallway likinwheel gaudy furious and thunderousittle further down the hall there waarnished yellow melodeon.
The horse crashed into it; it produceingle note almoshord in bass resonant and grave of deep and sober astonishment;  the horse with its monstrous and antic shadow whirled again and vanished through another door.
It waedroom; Ratliff in his underclothes and one sock and with the other sock in his hand and his back to the door was leaning out the open window facing the lane the lot.
He looked back over his shoulder.
For an instant he and the horse glared at one another.
Then he sprang through the window as the horse backed out of the room and into the hall again and whirled and saw Eck and the little boy just entering the front door Eck still carrying his rope.
It whirled again and rushed on down the hall and onto the back porch just as  Littlejohn carrying an armful of clothes from the line and the washboard mounted the steps.
"Get out of here you son oitch" she said.
She struck with the washboard; it divided neatly on the long mad face and the horse whirled and rushed back up the hall where Eck and the boy now stood.
"Get to hell out of here Wall!"
Eck roared.
He dropped to the floor covering his head with his arms.
The boy didn't move and for the third time the horse soared over the unwinking eyes and the unbowed and untouched head and onto the front veranda again just as Ratliff still carrying the sock came around the corner of the house and up the steps.
The horse whirled without breaking or pausing.
He galloped to the end of the veranda and took the railing and soared outward hobgoblin and floating in the moon.
It landed in the lot still running and crossed the lot and galloped through the wrecked gate and among the overturned wagons and the still intact one in which Henry's wife still sat and on down the lane and into the road.uarter oile further on the road gashed pallid and moony between the moony shadows of the bordering trees the horse still galloping galloping its shadow into the dust the road descending now toward the creek and the bridge.
It was of wood just wide enough foingle vehicle.
When the horse reached it it was occupied bagon coming from the opposite direction and drawn by two mules already asleep in the harness and the soporific motion.
On the seat was Tull and his wife in splint chairs in the wagon behind them sat their four daughters all returning belated from an all-day visit with some of  Tull's kin.
The horse neither checked nor swerved.
It crashed once on the wooden bridge and rushed between the two mules  which waked lunging in opposite directions in the traces the horse now apparently scrambling along the wagon-tongue itself likad squirrel and scrambling at the end-gate of the wagon with its forefeet as if it intended to climb into the wagon while Tull shouted at it and struck at its face with his whip.
The mules were now trying to turn the wagon around in the middle of the bridge.
It slewed and tilted the bridge-rail cracked witharp report above the shrieks of the women; the horse scrambled at last across the back of one of the mules and Tull stood up in the wagon and kicked at its face.
Then the front end of the wagon rose flinging Tull the reins now wrapped several times about his wrist backward into the wagon bed among the overturned chairs and the exposed stockings and undergarments of his women.
The pony scrambled free and crashed again on the wooden planking galloping again.
The wagon lurched again; the mules had finally turned it on the bridge where there was not room for it to turn and were now kicking themselves free of the traces.
When they came free they snatched Tull bodily out of the wagon.
He struck the bridge on his face and was dragged for several feet before the wrist-wrapped reins broke.
Far up the road now distancing the frantic mules the pony faded on.
While the five women still shrieked above Tull's unconscious body Eck and the little boy came up trotting Eck still carrying his rope.
He was panting.
"Which way'd he goe said.
In the now empty and moon-drenched lot his wife and  Littlejohn and Ratliff and Lump Snopes the clerk and three other men raised Henry out of the trampled dust and carried him into  Littlejohn's back yard.
His face was blanched and stony his eyes were closed the weight of his head tautened his throat across the protruding larynx; his teeth glinted dully beneath his lifted lip.
They carried him on toward the house through the dappled shade of the chinaberry trees.
Across the dreaming and silver nighaint sound like remote thunder came and ceased.
"There's one of them on the creek bridge" one of the men said.
"It's that one of Eck's" another said.
"The one that was in the house."
Littlejohn had preceded them into the hall.
When they entered with Henry she had already taken the lamp from the table and she now stood beside an open door holding the lamp high.
"Bring him in here" she said.
She entered the room first and set the lamp on the dresser.
They followed with clumsy scufflings and pantings and laid Henry on the bed and  Littlejohn came to the bed and stood looking down at Henry's peaceful and bloodless face.
"I'll declare" she said.
"You men."
Well when you go to the trouble to invent a—a private domain of your own then you're the master of time too.
audience laughteave the righhink to shift these things around wherever it sounds best  anan move them about in time and if necessary change their names.
This would be 1906 or '07 this happened.
That is the more you write the more you've got to compromise with such facts as time and place and so I've got to—to agree with Gwynn and establish this somewhere in time so it's about 1907.   have you ever such an auction taking placees'mought one of these horses once.
They appeared in our country.
Every summer somebody would come in with another batch of them.
They were western range-bred ponies pintos.
Had never haridle on them.
Had never seen shell corn before.
And they'd brought—be brought into our town and auctioned off for prices from three or four dollars up to six or seven anought this one for four dollars and seventy-five centsas— oeckon ten years old.
My father at that time raivery stable and there was a—a big man.
He was six feet analf tall.
He weighed two hundred pounds but mentally he was about ten years old too.
Ananted one of those horses.
My father said "Well if you and Buster can buy one for what money you've saved you can have it."
And so we went to the auction and we bought one for four dollars and seventy-five cents.
We got it home.
We were going to gentle it.
We hawo-wheel cart made out of the front axle ouggy with shafts on it and we fooled with that creature.
It was—waild animal.
It waild beast.
It wasn'omestic animal at all and finally Buster said that it was about ready so we had the cart ihed.
Estelle probably remembers this.
We puroaker sack over the horse's head and backed it into the cart with two niggers to—to fasten it in to buckle traces and toggles and things and me and Buster got in the seat and Buster said "All right boys let him go."
And they snatched the—the sack off the horse's head and it went across the lot.
There waig gate.
The lane had turned aharp angle.
It hung the inside wheel on the gatepost as it turned.
We were down on one hub then.
Then about that time Buster caught me by the back of the neck and threw me just like that and then he jumped off.
And the cart was scattered up that lane and we found the horse a—a mile away run intead-end street.
All he had left on him was just the hames the harness was gone.
But that waleasant experience.
But we kept that horse and gentled him to wherinally rode him.
Buoved that horse because that was my own horseought that with my own money.
..ow do you feel about your next novel or do you always feel that your next one is the bestell the—the one that I'm going to write this year is going to be the best.
The one thainished last year that's finished.
That's behind me.
There's nothing moran do to that but I'm going to do one this year that's still better which is probablappy attitude to have toward writing.
That is it's—it's fun to do.
It's like some people find playing golf fun to do or collecting stamps.
If you ever get the perfect stamp there's nothing else to collect.
If you ever writook that suits you exactly there's nothing else to do and so you hope that you really won't write one as good as you think it's going to be and of course you won'tYes ma'am.Do you feel that the gap between the people and the law that exists in "Spotted Horses" has closed any since thenhe gap between the people and—And the law.
And the law?
Uh huh.
Will you explaiittle more of what that means?
The law is so inappropriate and—and—and we feel that it's—in the end it's so ridiculous really.
It's—it's so far from the people and the way they live and it doesn't seem to apply to themust wondered if you felt that it were more appropriate now.
You mean tharmstid doesn't get her money back in court?
Yes.
Oh well that's one of the natural occupational hazards of breathing is conflict with the law with policehink that all people have to face that and accept it and do the best they can with it.
That's—if she had got her money back it'd been bad on me because my story would've blown up.
have you seen any of the productions of Requiem founaven'tave read the—the version that—that Camus did in French but then he turned it into an existentialist play  but I've never seen it on the stageould like toYes sir.Eula Varner seems to be the sort of character who would in some way seems almost larger than life seems to be invested with a—a meaning that's almost symbolic.
When you conceived this character did she seem to represent let us say some of the best aspects of the—the Varnersh you're quite right.
She was larger than life that she was—was an anachronism.
She had no place there that that little—little hamlet couldn't have held her and when she moved on to Jefferson that couldn't hold her either but then that'll be in the next book the one that'll be out next month.
You're quite right.
She was larger than life.
She was too big for this worldYes sir.To what extent are your plots and characters preconceived or in other words to what extent do you outline what is going to happen to your characters before you begin to write don't at alleharacter and—and get him or her started get him or her involved with somebody else and then they take charge of itust gallop along behind to put it down  but they are writing the book by that time.You—you have said previously that—that The Sound and the Fury came from an impression oittle girl up iree anondered how you built it from that and whether you just as you said let it—let the story develop itself.
Well impression is—is the wrong word.
It's more an imageery moving image to me was of the children.
Of course we didn't know at that time that one was an idiot but there were three boys—one wairl and the girl was the only one that was brave enough to climb that tree to look in the forbidden window to see what was going on and that's what the book ... and it took the rest of the 400 pages to explain why she was brave enough to climb the tree to look in the window.
It was an image a—a picture to me a—a very moving one which was symbolized by the muddy bottom of her drawers as her brothers looked up into the apple tree that she had climbed to look in the window and the symbolism of the muddy bottom of the drawers became the—the lost Caddy which had caused one brother to commit suicide and the other brother had—had misused her money that she'd sent back to the—to the child the daughter.
It was a—I thought—a short story something that could be done in about two pagehousand wordsound out it couldn'tinished it the first time and it wasn't right srote it again and that was Quentin.
That wasn't rightrote it again.
That was Jason.
That wasn't right.
Theried to let  do it.
That still was wrongYes sir.One thing that we sometimes seem to see with acquisitive people like the Snopeses is that after they have made the gains which they want very much to make respectability seems to set in and start to work on them too.
Do you see any signs of that happening in that clano only that the rapacious people if they're not careful they are seduced away and decide that what they've got to have is respectability which destroys one almost anybody.
That is nobody seems to be brave enough anymore to be a—an out-and-out blackguard or rascal that sooner or later he's got to be respectable  and that finishes it.Why aren't there blackguards thenhey ain't brave and strong and tough like they used to be.
And that's—And why nott's the—the curse of the times maybe.
It may be there'hree or four color printing of advertisements have—have been too seductive oicture oine big car in two colors witandsome young woman by it so that you almost think the woman comes with the new car  when you make the starter payments.
Money is—there's so much pressure to conform to—to be respectable.More than in the Victorian think so yes.
In the Victorian they tried to—to force you to be respectable to save your soul.
Now they compel you to be respectable to be rich.Were these people blackguards to save their souls?
I'm not quite surnderstand the connection.
Welhink that possibly the old Adam in man suggests to him to blackguard if he can get away with it and when there'reat deal of pressure to be respectable if there is—ireat enough reward for the respectability he will choose that in preference to the pleasure of beincoundrel anlackguard that people don't have enough verve and zest anymore which is not the fault of man so much as the fault of the times that we live in to where he—there's too much pressure against being an individualist and—and a—a good first-rate scoundrel is an individualist.
He don't really belong tang.
Once he's got to joiang he becomeecond-rate scoundrel buirst-rate scoundrel is likirst-rate artist.
He's an individualist and the pressure's all against being an individualist.
You've got to belong troup.
It don't matter much what group but you've got to belong to it or there's no place for you in the—the culture or the economy.
Maybe to belong tang you might escape the Atom bomb.
This—Are you saying that he has to be a—a scoundrel to be an individualisto siracoundrel to bood one must be an individualist.
That only an individualist can birst-rate scoundrel.
Only an individualist can birst-rate artist.
He can't belong troup ochool and birst-rate writer.
You could have some grudging admiration for Flem Snopes who pretty well sticks to his character.
Well until he was bitten by the bug to be respectable.
Then he let me down.
audience laughtead an admiration for him until then.
Any there good Snopeses?
That boy of Eck's seems likice little fellow.
Is he—is he going to get depraved tooo no.
He was—he turned into a—in his—his waretty good boy.
He wanted no more of Snopes.
He tried to remove himself from the—the aura and orbit of the Snopes.Somebody once wrot—maybe this is apocryphal that a—a couple of Snopeses who haven't yet been described but who—who might were to be described were named Dollar Watch Snopes and Montgomery Ward Snopes.
Is there any truth to thates there'ontgomery Wards Snopes.
He went to France in 1917 to keep from being drafted.
He joined the YMCA  and he came back witatch of—of French pornographic postcards and opened what he calletudio.
He—he had a—a Basque hat anindsor tie by that time.
He was an artist.
His studio haack door to it and if people joined the club they could look at the postcards  until the government caught him.
That was Montgomery Ward.Did he ever make it back to Americah yes.
This was back in Jefferson where he opened his studio.
you said before that it was your belief that man would prevail.
Well in the light of this book The Hamlet and several others that we've discussed recently what type of man do you think will prevail?
What kind?coundrelo no.
The scoundrel in time is seduced away by the desire to be respectable so he's finished.
There's a—what quality in man that prevails it's—it's difficult to be specific about but somehow man does prevail.
There's always someone that will—will never stop trying to cope with Snopes that will never stop trying to get rid of Snopes...ort of the lunatic fringe or somethinghatemnanto the—the impulse to eradicate Snopes is—is in my opinion so strong that it—it selects its champions when the crisis comes.
When the battle comes it always produceoland.
It doesn't mean that they will get rid of Snopes or the impulse which produces Snopes but always there's something in man that—that don't like Snopes and objects to Snopes and if necessary will step in to keep Snopes from doing some irreparable harm.
There's whatever it is that—that keeps us still trying to paint the pictures to make the music to write the books.
There'reat deal of pressure not to do that because certainly the artist has no place in—in nature and almost no place at all in our American culture and economy but yet people still try to write books still try to paint pictures.
They still go tot of trouble to—to produce the music anew people will always go to hear the music which still has nothing to do with—with the number of people that will produce the Cadillac cars or the economy which will give everybodhance to buadillac car on the installment plan or the deep freezers.
That is all that's advertised.
It has to be advertised in order to keep you buying it but the books the music that's not advertised yet still there're people that will pay for it and buy the pictures.
It'low process but yet it apparently goes on that we will even outlast the atom and hydrogen bombson't know right now how we will do it but my bet is we willYes sir.There's another version of this story isn't there?
It seems to memember one witewing machine agent telling it.
I'm sure there isave writteozen versions of itould—I would have to see them all to unravel them myself  but I'm sure there's any number of versions of it which is simply the—the craftsman's job to try it and try it and try it to have infinite patience to try and try and try until it comes as good as you can possibly make it.
When you have reached that point it still ain't good enough so you write another one and you try and try that one to bring it to the nearest perfection that you are capable of which still won't be the best one so you write another one.
When you reach this point where you don't do that anymore you cut the throatYes sir.Along this respectability/scoundrel line how do you explain Colonel Sutpen who sweeps into Jefferson and grimly sets himself up and along the line decides he'll have respectability?
Marches into town with the willpower that's possibly equaled only by his mother—his eventual mother-in-law.
Does he really lose his individuality or is respectability just another notch on his rifle so to speake wanted more than that.
He wanted revenge as he saw it but also he wanted to establish the fact that man is—is immortal.
That—that man if—if he is man cannot be inferior to another man through artificial standards or circumstances.
What he was trying to do—when he waoy he had gone to the front door oig house and somebodervant said "Go around to the back door."
He said "I'm going to be the one that lives in the big house.
I'm going to establisynastyon't care how."
And he violated all the rules of—of decency and honor and pity and compassion and the fates took revenge on him.
That's what that story was.
But he was trying to—to say in his blundering way that—that "Why shoulan be better than me because he's richer than me that iad had the chance I—I might be just as good as he thinks he is so I'll make myself as good as he thinks he is by getting the same outward trappings which he had"—which waig house and servants in it.
He didn't say "I'm—I'm going to be—be braver or more compassionate or more honest than he."
He just said "I'm going to be as rich as he was as big as he was on the outside.
"He never really attained this respectabilityo he was—the—the Greeks destroyed him the old Greek concept of tragedy.
He wanteon which symbolized this—this ideal and he got too many sons.
His sons destroyed one another and then him.
He was left with—the only son he had left waegroYes sir.You've said that you regarded respectability as one of the prime enemies of individualism.
Do you regard love as an enemy of individualismo not at all.
What's love got to do with respectability?
No sir I—I do not.
Respectability is—is an artificial standard which—which comes from up here.
That is respectability is—is not your concept or my concept.
It's what we think is Jones's concept of respectability.I don't mean to defend respectability in love or out.
Whaean  to do is—be quiet please.
Whaean to ask is—is this.
Isn't therasic dichotomy between the kind of individualism which you are praising and the attitude of lovef you will substitute decency for respectabilitould agree with youon't quite follow you between respectability and love but decency and love.
That's an interesting point.
Has anybody else gohought on that?
Well that's what Harry Wilbourne and the girl in Wild Palms discovered didn't they?
That they couldn't get love and respectability together they couldn't live in the twentieth century patterns the way they wanted to.
Yes that's right but then by Smith's conception of respectability they couldn't have had that anyway because one was already married.
So there wahoice about will we take what we can or will we havittle or nothing anittlhink is always better than nothing.
do you regard Pyloerious novel and what were you driving at in that novelo me they were a—a fantastic and—and bizarre phenomenon on the—the—the face of a—oontemporary scene of our culture aarticular timerote that book because I'd gotten in trouble with—with Absalom Absalom!
anad to get away from it fohile shoughood way to get away from it was to write another book srote Pylon.
They were ephemera anhenomena on the face of a—oontemporary scene.
That is there was really no place for them in—in—in the culture in the economy yet they were there at that time and everyone knew that they wouldn't last very long which it didn't.
That time of those frantic little aeroplanes which dashed around the country and people wanting just enough money to—to live to get to the next place to race again something frenetic and iay almost immoral about it that they were outside—outside the range of—of God not only respectability of love but of—but of God too that they had escaped the—the compulsion of—of acceptinast anuture that they were—they had no past.
They were as—as ephemeral as—as the butterfly that—that's born this morning with no stomach and will—will be gone tomorrow which seemed to me interesting enough to maktory about.
But that was just to get away froook that wasn't going too well untiould get back at it.I think that perhaps we've used up enough of  's energy unless sir you feel the wish to carry oit more.
Surely.
If anyone can suggest something we can discuss by all means.
You might—when should this stop?
What do you—Well it has no set closing hour but—but  we don't want to tire you.
Well I've told you—this ireadful habit to get into where you can stand up in front of people and talk and nobody can say shut up and sit down.
and   will answer questions now.
We will havumber of them on "Was" preferably.
Yes sir.Siyce playinor part in "Was" and iew more of your storieelieve.
Well iyce jusongrel or is he an out-of-the-ordinary mongrel that you might equate with the primitivee is—in our Mississippi jargon he is any small dog usually he waox or rat terrier at one time that has gotten mixed up with hound with bird-dog everything else but any small dog in my country is calleyce.Can we look upon him as representing the primitive such as the bear and the foresto he's the—iay the—the—the antithesis of the bear.
The bear represented the obsolete primitive.
The fyce represents the—the creature who has coped with environment and is still on top of it you might say.
That he has—instead of sticking to his breeding and—and becoming a—a decadent degenerate creature he has mixed himself up with the good stock where he picked and chose.
And he's quite smart.
He's quite brave.
All's against him is his size.
Buever kneyce yet that realized that he wasn't as big as anything else he ever saw eveear.
Yes sir.
into what strata would these people fit— Hubert and Miss Sophonsiba ...hey were the aristocracy of provincial Mississippi at that time.
It was still frontier.
In Natchez they had the fine Empire furniture.
People had—they spent their money on objets-d'art from Europe furnishings and fine clothes.
In—in the country these people they were aristocracy but they were still frontier they were still the—the tall man with the long rifle iay.
That even their splendor waittle on the—the slovenly side that they went through the motions of—of living like dukes and princes but their life wasn't too different from the man who lived iud-floored hovel.
No they represented the aristocracy.
They were the wealthy the men of power the owners of slaves.
Yes sir.Could you explain the significance of the title "Was"eas—this was the first chapter iook.
The book was composed of short stories.
It covered a—a great deal of time.
The central character in the book waan named Isaac McCaslin who was old at the time of the book.
But this background which produced Isaac McCaslin had to be told by somebody and so this is Isaac McCaslin's uncle.
This Cass here is not old Ike this is Ike's uncle.
And "Was" simply because Ike is saying to the reader "I'm not telling this this was my uncle my great-uncle that told it."
That's the only reason for "Was" that this was the old time.
But it's part of him too.
Yes sir.Sir does the presentation of the ribbon to Uncle Buddy have any significance from medieval tales or anythinges that was Miss Sophonsiba with that belief of hers and her brother too that they were the rightful heirs to ... to die for his choice.
Yes sir.Sir do you look at your humor as a—with the same inspiration as you derious thing or is it morelaxing kind of worko no it'art of man too.
It'art of life.
That people are—there's not too finistinction between humor and tragedy that even tragedy is—is iay walkinightrope between the ridiculous—between the bizarre and the—and the terrible.
That it's—possibly the writer uses humor aool that he's still trying to—to write about people to write about man about the human heart in some moving way and so he uses whatever tool that he thinks will do most to finish the—the picture which at the moment he is—he is trying to paint of man.
That he will use humor tragedy just as he uses violence.
They are tools but an ineradicable part of life humor is.
Yes sir.What is the significance of the title "Red Leaves"ell that was probably symbolism.
The—the red leaves referred to the Indian.
It was the—the deciduation of nature which no one could stop that had suffocated smothered destroyed the Negro.
That the red leaves had nothing against him when they suffocated and destroyed him.
They had nothing against him.
They probably liked him but it was normal deciduation which the red leaves whether they regretted it or not had nothing more to say in.
Yes sir.Sir you use hunting terms all through "Was" when they're chasing Tomey's Turl.
Is there any significance to this—I mean do they think that perhaps this colored man is not about—well say he's on the same plane as the foxt that—at that time he was at the very time that these twin brothers had believed that there was something outrageous and wrong in slavery and they had done what they could.
In fact they had—had given up their father's fine mansion to let the slaves live in it and they had builwo-room log cabin that they lived in.
That they by instinct knew that—that slavery was wrong but they didn't know quite what to do about it.
And in the heat of—of the pursuit—of well in—in—in daily life they would use the terms in which the Negro was oevel with the dog or the animal they ran.
And especially in the heat oace which—though—though this was more of—of deadly purpose than simple pleasure in the heat of running—running this man the man became quarry that would have received the same respect that—that the bear or the deer would—that is the bear or the deer would have his chance for his life.
They wouldn't have betrayed him tricked him.
They wouldn't have buileadfall for him.
They would have run him all fair with the dogs and if he could escape could kill the dogs and get away good for him.
If he couldn't it was too bad.Sir never having been fox-hunting what do you mean by "going to earth" as far as Tomey's Turl was concernedhat's when the quarry finds a—a hole in the grounen and runs into it.
The fox before the dogs he will try first to—to trick the dogs and if he can't then he gets into something that the dogs can't follow him into.
He goes—finds an old fox den or something that he knows that—that the dog is too big to follow he gets in there he's gone to earth.
Yes sir.Sir did Tomey's Turl stack the deck?
And if sOh yes because he wanted Tennie and he wanted to go back home and take Tennie with him.Welnderstood that in the last thing it says that if he—if  Hubert didn't call Uncle Buddy then everything would stay just the way it was and that Tomey's Turl would go back with Uncle Buddy and Uncle Buck and that Tennie would stay with  Hubert and leave it just the way it was before.
No no if Uncle Buddy saved Uncle Buck from Miss Sophonsiba then Uncle Buddy would have to buy Tennie.
That was the way the bet was settled and so Tomey's Turl he didn't care whether Uncle Buck was safe from Miss Sophonsiba or not but he wanted Tennie to go back home with him and so he—he hunted around found that last deuce for Uncle Buddy.
He was playing for Tennie.
Uncle Buddy was playing for his brother to save his brother.
Their aims were the same though the end was slightly different.
Yes sir.Sir in another one of your stories "Percy Grimm" do you think that the type of person that is exemplified there is prevalent in the South today perhaps in the White Citizens Councils wouldn't say prevalent.
He exists everywhererote that—that book in 1932 before I'd ever heard of Hitler's Storm Troopers.
What he was waazi Storm Trooper but then I'd never heard of one then and he's not prevalent but he's everywhereouldn't say that there are more of him in the South buould say that there are probably more of him in the White Citizens Council than anywhere else in the South but I—I think you find him everywhere in all countries in all people.
Yes sir.Sir was Percy Grimm ever punished for his crime think in time that—that every Storm Trooper suffers for it.
He don't suffer any retribution any stroke of lightning from the gods but he's got to live with himself and there comeime when you've got to live with that when you're too old and the—the—the fire which enables you to geertain amount of hysterical adrenalic pleasure out of things like that is gone and—and all you have left is to remember what you did and you probably wonder why in God's name you did things like that and you have to live with it.
And I—I think that quite often unexplained suicides go back to some man who has done something like that and he gets old and he's got to live with it and decides it's not worth living with it.
Yes sir.You spokittle while ago of Greek themesas wondering if you think that modern literature or twentieth-century literature so to speak could feature the truly tragic hero that you would find in Greek times or do you think the characters should be meaner or more simple?
...  That'ifficult question to answerhink the writer has got to write in terms of his environment and his environment consists not only in—in the—the immediate scene but his readers are part of that environment too and maybe nobody can—can write forever without expecting to be read and probablriter whether he intends to or not or knows it or not is going to shape what he writes in—in the terms of—of who will read it.
So—so maybe when there are fine listeners there will be fine poets again that maybe the—the writing that is not too good is—is not just the writer's fault it may be because of the environmenart of which is the general effluvium of—of the readers the people who will read it that does something to the air they all breathe together that compels the shape of the book.
It would be fine if people could write in—in the old simple clear Hellenic tradition but then maybe that would be now obsolete that there waime for that the time for that is not now.
It may come back if life does go in cycles.
Yes sir.Sir in your excerpt from The Unvanquished "An Odor of Verbena" why is that sprig of verbena left on Bayard's pillow right at the very end when she leaves she says she's going to abjure verbena for ever and ever and then he goes off he walks into town and he meets  Redmonelieve it is and then without any gun or anything and then comes back and the sprig of verbena is left on his pillow.
That—of—of course the—the verbena was associated with Drusilla with that woman and she had wanted him to takistol and—and avenge his father's death.
He—he went to the man who had shot his father unarmed and instead of killing the man by that—that gesture he drove the man out of town and although that had—had violated Drusilla's traditions of an eye for an eye she—the spring of verbena meant that she realized that that took courage too and maybe more moral courage than to—to have drawn blood or to have taken another step in an endless feud of an eye for an eye.But then why did she leaveecause she was at that time too old she was still too involved in it to accept that morallyean accept it physically that her husband had not been—been avenged by his own son.
That is her intellect said—said "This warave thing" but the Eve in her said "My husband my lover has not been avenged."
And she could say "You were brave" but she—"this is not for me that I—that sort of bravery is not for me."
Yes sir.Sir is there any reason for the Southern—the blossoming of Southern writing that is are there any circumstances in the Southern environment that would bring about the blossoming of great writers as it has don't know.
That'iterary question.
Anouldn't undertake to answer itight say that when that so-called blossoming of Southern writers came along it was aime when nobody in the South had much money.
They couldn't travel and they had to invenorlittle different from the shabby one they lived in so they took to writing which is cheaper than a—that ieam of paper anencil is cheaper thaailroad ticket.
Yes sir.Sir why in the beginning of your book about—you mention Ikkemotubbe why does Ikkemotubbe cease to own the land as soon as he realizes that it is saleable and do the people like the Compsons who have bought the land do they ever belong to the land in the sense that Ikkemotubbe previously hadon't think they dohink the—the ghost of—of that—that ravishment lingers in the land that the land is inimical to the white man because of the unjust way in which it was taken from Ikkemotubbe and his people.
That happened by treaty which President Jackson established with the Chickasaws and the Choctaws in which they would take land in Oklahoma in exchange for their Mississippi land.
And they were paid for it but they were compelled to leave it either to—to leave on—to follohimera in the West or to stay there in a—a condition even worse than the—the Negro slave in isolation.
There arew of them still in Mississippi but they faiood deal like animals ioo they have no—no place in the culture in the economy unless they become white men and they have in some cases mixed with white people and the—their own conditions have vanished or they have mixed with Negroes and they have descended into the Negroes' condition of semi-peonage.And even the aristocracy the original aristocracy was tainted.
They never owned the land.
The land was never theirs.
That's right.
They—the Indians held the land communally a—a few of them that were wise enough to see which way the wind was blowing would get government patents for the land.
There was one of thehoctaw chief was one of the wealthiest men in Mississippi Greenwood Leflore.
He was wise enough to—to geatented deed to his land and to take up the white man's ways.
He waotton planter.
He builremendous mansion and imported the furnishings from France and he was quite wealthy.
And then when in '61 he declined to accept the Confederacy and Confederate troops were sent in there and his—his—his stables were set on fire the story is that when—when they demanded that he accept an oath to the Confederacy he went into the house and gonited States flag and wrapped it around himself and—and came out and walked into that burning barn and died there but that's—we don't know whether that's so or not but that's the legend.
But the house is still there.
It'useum now and—and his descendants they are two great-great-nieces.
They're mostly white now.
They own the place.
..ant to thank you on behalf of me and the class members.
We meet in this room on Monday and Wednesday.
Thank you.
Yes sir.This question is about Light in August.
Could you tell me your purpose in placing the chapter about Hightower's early life in the end of the novel rather than when Hightower first appearedt may be this.
Unless a—a book follows a—a simple direct line such atory of—of adventure it becomes a—a series of pieces.
It'ood deal like—like dressinhowcase window.
It takeertain amount of—of judgment and—and taste to arrange the different pieces in the most effective place in juxtaposition to one another.
That was the reason.
It seemed to me that was the most effective place to put that to—to underline the—the tragedy of Christmas's story by the tragedy of—of his antithesisan who—Hightower waan who—who wanted to be better than he was afraid he would.
He had failed his wife.
Here was another chance he had and he failed his—his Christian oath aan of God and he escaped into—to his past where some member of his family was brave enough to match the moment.
But it was put at that point in the boohink becaushought that was the most effective place for it.
Yes sir.Sir do you find it easier to createmale character in literature oale charactert's much more fun to try to write about women becaushink women are marvelous.
They're wonderful annow very little about them  and so I—it's much more fun to try to write about women than about men.
More difficult yes.
Yes sir.Sir in "Delta Autumn" in a—the thoughts of Ike McCaslin when he's talking to the colored girl you write "Maybe ihousand or two thousand years in America but not now not now.as—I was wondering how you might apply that to the present-day conditions that have happened since the writing of the story with the Supreme Court decision and what-not.
He used "a thousand or two thousand years" in his despair.
He had seeondition which was intolerable which shouldn't be but it was and he was saying in effect that—that this—this must be changed.
This cannot go on but I'm too old to do anything about it that maybe ihousand years somebody will be young enough and strong enough to do something about it.
That was—that was all he meant by the numbers buhink that he saw as—as everybody that thinks thaondition like that is—is intolerable not so much intolerable to man's sense of justice but maybe intolerable to—tondition to the condition that—that any country has reached the point where if it is to endure it must have no inner conflicts based on a—a wronasic human wrong.
Yes sir.
in your—your story "A Rose—A Rose for Emily" was she drawn from a—froeal person—real character or is she made up out of your mindo nhinriter uses observation experience imagination.
He never knows just how much of which he does use buon't believe you can writery good or very moving story abouuman being in the—the—the proscribed limits of—otory oook and takuman being from life.
It takes sixty years to—to creatomplete and rounded human being but the writer hasn't got that much time.
He's only got thirty minutes or at the best three or four hours and so probably any writer is—has madomposite picture.
It's—it's people he knew or things he imagined things he read things he heard but he wouldn't bother with trying to—to reduce to paper or to put onto paper any living creature.
Also there's a—a quality of—of God-like omnipotence that the fury of—of creating something gives you and you're not satisfied with the way God did it.
You can improve on him jusittle.
Yes sir.Sir in "Was" can you tell us how Uncle Buck successfully foiled an attempt by  Hubert Beauchamp to get him to marry Sophonsiba?
Well eventually they do get married anonder if you could give us any idea as to how she eventually caught himhink that—that women are much stronger much more determined than men and just because these men had wasted an evening oveeck of cards that hadn't changed Miss Sophonsiba's intentions at all.
And probably Uncle Buck finally just gave up.
That was his fate and he—he might just as well quit struggling.
Yes sir.Sir can you tell us where Sutpen acquired his money in "Wedding in the Rain" when he came back and he—first he came back with the architect and all his—the Negroes or sort of creatures that he had and built his house and later on came back with the furnishings.
He very likely looted his Caribbean father-in-law's plantation when he married the daughteron't know thaver decided myself just how he did it but very likely he looted and wrecked—wrecked the whole place took—took the girl because he didn't want her especially.
He wanteon.
He wanted to establish his dynasty.
Anmagine that—that he—he got that money to the States and then had to hide it here and there.
There were no banks in those days no safe place to put it.
Probably was—was gold something that was intrinsic of itself and he would go off wherever he had buried it and dig uittle more when he needed it.
Yes ma'am.Sir in your story "The Bear" why did Boon kill Sam Fathersecause Sam asked him to.
Sam's life had finished then.
He was an old man.
He was sick and—and Sam at that point represented his whole race.
The white man had dispossessed the whole race.
They had nothing left and Sam was old.
He was weak and sick.
That was the—the Greek conception.
And Sam knew that Boon and this little boy who was too young to have used the knife or whatever it was would defend Sam's right to die and would approve of the fact that Boon the instrument was willing to—to kill Sam.
But Sam was done with life and he wanted that done and—and Boon was the servant that did it.
Yes sir.Sir in "A Rose for Emily" is it possible to take Homer Barron and Emily and sort of show that one represents the South and the North?
Was there—was there anything on your part there trying to show the North and the South in sort oattle?
Maybe Miss Emily representing the South coming out victorious in the odd way that she didhat would be only incidentalhink that—that the writer is too busy trying to create flesh and blood people that will stand up and cashadow to have time to—to be conscious of—of all the symbolism that he may put into what he does or what people may read into it that if he had time to—that is if one individual could—could write the authentic credible flesh-and-blood character and at the same time deliver the message maybe he would buon't believe any writer is—is capable of doing both that he's got to choose one of the two.
Either he is deliverinessage or he's trying to create flesh-and-blood living suffering anguishing human beings.
And as any man works out of his—his past since any man—no man is himself he'um of his past and iay if you can accept the—the term of his future too.
And this struggle between the South and the North could have beeart of my background my experience without me knowing it.
Yes sir.Sir why is it in "Death Drag" Jock left Captain—despite Captain Warren's plea to stay there or to accept the raincoat or to accept any sort of job.
Was there anything besides pride that made him leave fly off in that old cratees it was—well pride was about what it was.
The—it's of course—It is probably true of all—all flying people buo know that—that the flying people out of that war most of them would've been better off if they had died on the eleventh of November that few of them were any good to—to try to take up the burden of peace and this—this man was—was lost and doomed.
Of course Warren was different.
He had managed to cope with—with 1919 but this other man would never cope with 1919.
He was hopeless.
He was doomed.
Yes sir.Sir in your novels you said in one of the other classes that you begin witharacter in mind or more than one character.
In your short stories do they—do you conceive of them in the same way or do you start witerson or do you—ometimes witerson sometimes with an anecdote.
But the—the short story is conceived in the same terms that the book is.
The—the first job the craftsman faces is to tell this as quickly and as simply aan.
And if he's good if he's of—of the first order like Chekhov he can do it every time in two or three thousand words but if he's not that good sometimes it takes him eighty thousand words.
But they are—are similar and he is simply trying to tell something which was true and moving in the shortest time he can and then if he has sense enough stop.
That ion't believe the man or the woman sits down and says "Now I'm going to writhort story" or "Now I'm going to writovel."
It's an idea that begins with the—with the—the thought the image oharacter or of an anecdote and even in the same breath almost like lightning it—it begins to takhape that he can see whether it's going to bhort story oovel.
Sometimes not always.
Sometimes he thinks it'll bhort story and finds that he can't.
Sometimes it looks like it's to bovel and then after he works on it he sees that it's not that he can tell it in two thousand or five thousands words.
No rule to it.
Yes sir.Sir is it true that you don't read your criticses that's right.Could you elaborate on that?
Well when the—the work is finished and it don't suit me and I'm the one that's got to be suited and that one didn't so by that time I'm busy working on another one anust don't get around to reading the critics  because that to me is water under the bridge.
You see there's nothing moran do to it.
And he can't do anything to it either.
Yes sir.Do you ever read your own work over again afteapse of say—  No that's the nice thing about writing.
That's always one book you won't have to read no matter how long it is.
Do you have any trouble remembering sahort story you might've written in 1925 or something like that remember the people buan't remember what story they are in nor always what they didave to go back and look at it to unravel what the person was doingemember the character though.
when you read do you frequently find that you get so many ideas after readinew pages that you find yourself more willing and interested in beginning to write something or continue to read?
That is do you think writers find difficulty in readingell I'm—I'm convinced that the writer never stops working that even when he's reading he—he is not deliberately looking for—for ideas or what we might say—call inspiration but he never knows just when from—from what page what paragraph in what book something might strike him.
He's got to put that book down and geiece of paper and write.
I'm convinced of thatYes.When you think ohort story oovel taking shape in your mind and you know which form it's to take how much oattern do you have in mind as it takes shape before you get it down on paperot always too much.
If you—if it's all complete the—the form and the pattern too then it'our de force.
That's jusatter of sitting down and swatting it out but if—if it's an idea and then begins to take a—a tremendous and nebulous almost formless shape then the book itself commands its—its progress that the book itself takes charge and doeertain amount of selectinghink that you think of—of any number of—of things actions that the characters might perform and what they might say that there's no place in the story that you're telling for.
They sound fine to you but there just ain't any place in that story that the—the book itself has taken charge says "No no we don't want that.
We'll have this one.
"Yes sir.When writinovel ohort story do you get obsessed with your thoughts and do you write constantly for hours on end or do you more or less look at it objectively Well it's—it's fun to do and the tendency is to—to overdo it just like you're iame something you like that you—your judgment would say you'd better stop now you're getting tired you're not—not doing too well but it's still fun and you keep on.
I've made—I tried to make one rule to stop while it's still hot.
That is to leave it while I'm looking good as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes says.Do you ever jump up in the middle of the night and write something downh yes.
Yes lots of times.
I've never had any—any orderave heard of people that can set aside so many houray and—or to write so many worday but that has never been for merite when it's hot theuit and rest and theet at it again sometimes fourteen or sixteen houray and then sometimeon't writord for fourteen or sixteen days.
Yes sir.Sir in Intruder in the Duselieve you say that integration in the South could only be accomplished by the South itself through some external means of triggering you might say?hink you used the expression "a snowball starting an avalanche."
Yes.Well exactly how far do you think this is going right now this snowballt was going along too slowly I—I mean not too slowly for the white people in the South but too slowly for—for the Negro.
But it was moving.
It—it was actually in motion.
The last two or three years it has stopped and—and in ways has retrograded.
There waittle too much pressure from outside.
But there are—are people in the South that more than—than just—just me that recognize the situation as being intolerable not froumanitarian point of view but froractical point of view thaountry cannot endure witinority as big as seventeen million people second-rate citizens.
It just—faced with the—with the trouble that we face in the world that's—that's bad—bad business.And you think that this triggering effect lasted too long that it should've been ceased soonerell it—the—the push carried on too long.
If there'd beeudge and then stop and let the ball move of its own weight.
But success goes to anyone's head and it creates its own illusion and the people who had felt that things were going too slow that that's—anything that slow was not progress it was difficult to tell them to stop.
You couldn't expect them to stop.
That that has—has done harm buhink that will not really delay equality for the Negro.
It will causreat deal of—of trouble and anguish and individuals will suffer buhink the course of—of the Negro's advancement in the South hasn't been hurt by thison't think it's been helped very much by it except that—that somebody somewhere has got to nudge us now and then that we do go too slow if it's left to ourselves.
People are too prone to say "Oh well things are all right."
Like the sign in the Pullman Car that says "Quiet is requested for the sake of those who have already retired."
That sort of thing you know.
Yes sir.Sir I—I understand with Sanctuary you've said that it was written for the sensational value of it.
Would you say now fooung writer who might be trying to break into it do you think that he should devote his time and talents if any towardensational type of work or do you think that he should try and write more or less from the soul you might say or write as he—as he feels rather than what he feels might be accepted would say if he is creating characters which are flesh-and-blood people are believable and are honest and true then he can use sensationalism if he thinks that's an effective way to tell his story.
But if he's writing just for sensationalism then he has betrayed the—his vocation and he deserves to suffer from it.
That is sensationalism is—is iay an incidental tool that he might use sensationalism as the carpenter picks up another hammer to drivail but he doesn't—the carpenter don't builouse just to drive nails.
He drives nails to builouse.
Yes sir.Would you say Peyton Place was justified in the—in the sensationalism?
Have you read that don't know the book but if—if they are flesh-and-blood people if—if he was trying to write about human beings rather than about sensation in the sensationalism Yeill accept and pass.
But if he was just trying to write sensationalism then that's another horse.Do you have time to read quititlenty of timeon't do itead the booknew and loved wheaoung man read them over and over.
The new oneon't—don't keep up with too well unless someone tells me "This is a—a good book you should read it."
Theill stop and read it.When you read these books you've read beforo you find new things in them constantlyn the sense that—that you find new things in—in old friends.
That is there's some reason that—that you like to go back and spend a—an hour or two with an old friend.
It may not be—be for anything new unless the evocation witittle more experience on your own part will—will throew light onto something that you thought you knew before and you find now you didn't that you maybe knoittle more about truth that what the—the good writers say to the young man he knows instinctively are true things.
Later on as he knowittle more he knows why they're true and in that sense it is something new yes.Could you give us some of the titles of these books Yes'mead Don Quixote ever yearead the Old Testamentead some of Dickens ever year and I've goortable Shakespearne-volume Shakespeare thaarry along with me.
Conrad.
Moby-Dick.
Chekhov.
Madame Bovary.
Some of Balzac almost every year.
Tolstoyaven't—haven't thought of Artzybashev in yearshink I'll get the—him out and read him again.
Artzybashev.
Gogol.
Most of the Frenchmen of the nineteenth century I—I read in every year.
Yes sir.
you must've read some of Erskine Caldwell once upoime.id yes.
When he first began to write and the stuff was—was first ratideaot of iteaot of all my coevals at that time.
Sorry.
We'll go ahead here then.
Yes sir.Sir of the new books you say you occasionally read have you found any in the last few years that you regard as superior books superior writing remember one abouestroyer in the Pacific believe he was a—a Virginia man Eyster?
That wahought—thought a—a pretty good book.
There'oung man in Mississippi named Shelby Foote that—that shows promise if he'll just stop trying to write  and write some Shelby Foote.
And—yes I've seen a—seeew books buon't remember titles nor writers too wellemember characters and—and incidents that seem to be me to be true which is—is the test.
I'm sorry there were—were you next?
Or you?
Well sir you then.What about the Greek tragedies?
Do you ever enjoy reading thoseheas young yesaven't—haven't read it any of the Greek tragedies iong time.
But wheas young yes.Sir we take for granted .... Do you read primarily the books that you've read you say when you were younger or the books of times gone by?
You don't think terribly highly of the books that are put out say in the last twenty yearselon't know you see becausaven't—haven't seen them.
It's simply because as—as the writer grows old—I've heard other writers say this too they read less and lesson't know why that is but—but most writers as they grow old they seem to read less and less.
It's not that they're indifferent to their—to their juniors.
It's—it can't be any jealousy becaushink that any sincere writer has—has failed to do what he'd like to do.
That is it—it's not better than was ever done before.
But he has enough belief in his—in his craft his—his avocation to be convinced that behind him someone is come—coming that will do it that may do it.
And aay I—it's not because I—I don't like to read anymoreimply read less thaid.
And wheo read it's—it's when there's nothing better to do you might say and so I'll pick up the book just to pass time.
Wheas youngeas an avid reader becausas learning.
That was the waearned my craftead everythinould get my hands on to see how it was done what to do.
Yes sir.Sir what do you think of Aristotle's theories about tragedy?
There's wide dispute about that now with Death oalesman do you think he's right or ...hat theory is this?
That—tharagedy must—the hero must ban of high place so that he can fall all the further.
Welon't think Aristotle meant by high place what—what it sounds likehink he meant a—a man of—of integrity more than a—thaan of aristocracy unless—is that what you meant by high place?
Well that's whaayelieve he does mean money-wise and society-wise rather than integrity but I'm not an authority on that but that's—  Welhink that was because he used the—the high place the—the money the riches or the—the title as—as symbols that a—thaing must be bravueen must be chaste as simple symbols as puppets.
But tragedy as Aristotle saw it it's—I would say is—is the same conception of tragedy that all writers have.
It—it's man wishing to be braver than he is in—in combat with his heart or with his fellows or with the environment and how he fails.
At the—the splendor the courage of his failure that—and the—the trapping of royalty of kingship were simply trappings to make him more splendid so that he was worthy of—of being selected by the gods by Olympus as an opponent that man couldn't cope with him so it would takod to do it to cast him down.
Yes sir.
I'm interested in the relationship between your observation about the critical process as being primarily an imaginative one in which you—you do not simply try to holirror up tarticular character in the scene but in which your product is the product of your imagination which is in the background the product of all that you've learned.
This you—you've said meant that—means that iriter setattern for himself and sees the pattern of the whole work then his writing becomes merelatter of swatting it out.
Does this mean for example that Paradise Lost in which the pattern was set is targe extent merelatter of swatting it out or that any man who like Spenser in the Faerie Queen conceives of an idea as the objective rather than the production of the mere product of imagination does this mean also that Spenser did just swatting it out don't think soon't think that the pattern as he sees it is—is that rigid that the pattern is—is a—ieneral idea within accepted or circumscribed limits but not rigid limits.
They're simply circumscribed.
That—that the imagination must be checked by something... and the pattern conform or—or meet or be amicable we'll say and when one has to givelieve it's always the pattern that has to give and so he's got to rewrite to createw pattern witulge that will take this—this bulge of the imagination which insists that it's true.
It must be.
Yes ma'am.
beforsk this question I'd like to say thaeally agree with what you saihile ago about the races in the South.
Carlylelieve said of words that indignation makes verses.
Do you also think that indignation makes great novelses'm it depends on what the indignation is toward.
If it's indignation towarondition it doesn't always makreat novel.
It could maybe.
It's got to be an indignation at—at man's condition not his—his particular situation but at his condition.
It's something that's—that's got to be strong enough to—to raise the steam to make the artist assume the anguish and trouble and travail of putting something down on paper or in music or to paint it or to hack it out oiece of marble.
That's—could be indignation but it's—it's indignation at man's conditioelieve not at a—aarticular instance of injustice or cowardice.
That might be the germ in which an individual the—the conception oan the idea of an individual against that—that temporary condition could make the book but that book didn't create the—the individual.
The individual is the—the tool to—to show the condition.
Yes sir.
did you ever find yourself surprised at repeating yourself when you say "By Jovid that thing better twenty-five years ago" or "By Jove this is better than it was twenty-five years ago"o because to me there ain't any better.
It's either good or it's nothing and it's—whaid twenty-five years ago didn't suit me and sorgot that.
I'm— I'm working on another oneope that this one is going to be the right one.
Of coursnow it ain't but  the one twenty-five years ago is under the bridge.
It's too bad but there's nothinan do about it anymore except writew one.Yes sir.Do you think the author has the prerogative to create his own language in other words to go against what the people create vernacular?
Do you think an author has the right to create his own—I believe Joyce and Eliot have done it have tried to create—they found that language was not—did not suit their purpose so they had to go beyond and make their own language.
He has the right to do that provided he don't insist on anyone understanding it.
That—that is what I'm trying—trying to say is that—I believe I'm paraphrasing Whitman; didn't he say "To have good poets we must have good readers too" something like that?
Who knows?
Great audiences.
That's—well the writer actually—that's an—an obligation that he assumes with his vocation that he's going to write it iay that—that people can understand it.
He doesn't have to write it in the way that—that every idiot can understand it every imbecile in the third grade can understand it but he's got to usanguage which—which is accepted and in which the words havpecific meaning that everybody agrees onhink that—that Finnegan's Wake and Ulysses were—were justified but then it's hard to say on what terms they were justified.
That waase oenius who was electrocuted by the divine fire.
Yes sir.
it's often been said about great novels or great short stories that they wouldn't pass muster in the freshman English composition course.
Noas wondering since this is your first day at the University if you had any comments on the traditional or the apparently traditional conflict between the creative writer and the schoolmanell as an old veteran sixth grader that question ihink out—outside of my province  becausever got to freshman Englishon't know how much it would conflict.
Maybe before I've left the Universitill be able to pass freshman English.
Yes sir.
with more and more capable Negroes coming to the fore in all facets of the public life do you believe that halozen capable Negro fiction writers could dorld of good for the segregation problem do yes.Out of seventeen million people and some of them becoming very adequate physicians and lawyers don't you believe that they can develop some writers of stature also do yeshink that—that people like Armstrong and Dr. Ralph Bunche and George Washington Carver have done much more for the Negro race than—than all of the—the NAACP leaders much more.
And there's no reason at all why—why the Negro shouldn't produce good writers.
He has got to have— he has got to be freed of—of the—of the curse of his color.
He's—he's got to—to have equality in terms that he can get used to it and forget that—that he is—iegro while he's writing just like the white man hasn't got time to remember whether he's a—a Gentile oatholic while he's writing.
And the Negro has got to—to reach that stage and the white man's got to help him because he can't do it by himself under these conditions.He's in the best position to write sympathetically about his own conditionse should be yes.
But you can't write sympathetically abouondition when it's—when it'onstant outrage to you you see.
You've got to be objective about itdo you look on Ike McCaslin as having fulfilled his destiny the things that he learned from Sam Fathers and from the other men as in his—when he was twelve to sixteen?
Do you feel that they stood him in good stead all the way through his life do yes.
They—they didn't give him success but they gave him somethinot more important even in this country.
They gave him serenity.
They gave him what would pass for wisdomean wisdom as contradistinct from the schoolman's wisdom of education.
They gave him that.
And was—did he ever have any childreno.
Was he able to pass on this wisdom—  No no children.That had been transmitted to himay every—every little eight- or ten-year-old boy was his son his child the ones that he taught how to hunt.
He had passed on what he had.
He was not trying to tell them how to slay animals.
He was trying to—to teach them what he knew of—of respect for whatever your lot in life is that if—if your lot is to bunter to slay animals you slay the animals with—with the nearest approach you can to dignity and to decencyYes sir.I think you were speaking about the act of creatiohile ago.
Sometimes we read that many authors seem to—to create with a—witigh degree of objectivity and that other authors have the feeling that when they're going about this process they are almost in the very act of experiencing literally the things that—that their created people are experiencing.
In some of—of the people that you've created that you have enjoyed doing most or felt you hit off most truly have you ever had the illusion or the feeling that in the act of creation that the sensations were—you were experiencing them almost as if this act were literally happening to youot exactly because when my people come alive they take charge of what we're doing and I'm going at a—a dead run to keep up and put down what they do and sayon't have time to—to think much about myself in this business.
I'm too busy trying to keep up with them that they—they talk and act too fast.
I'm afraid that—that itop foinute I'll miss something.
Annow thaan't invent it because they've taken charge.
They're doing the inventing by that time.
I'm just the secretary by then.
Yes sir.Sir you say you invent that.
Well I—I imagine this might come of one of your very very long sentences but yet you say they're very carefully contrived.
Well what do you do?
Get down what comes out and then go back and work over ithat's right.Perfect ithat's right.
It's—I think that probably goes back to the burden which man carries all his life is the knowledge of death.
That is he knows that he won't live forever and he's found something so amazing and so moving which is—is breathing or being—being in the worlart of it and iay he is attempting to write the whole history of the human heart on the head oin because he thinks he may not last long enough to put it down on anything as big aiece of paper.
Alshink thaan at any moment of action is the living sum of his past that—and the reason for—for the long sentences that go so far into the past and into the future is that belief that man at the very moment at which he is doing something he did that particular thing exactly in that way because of the hundred years before him that made him and that's simplatter of trying to remind the reader that—that this man is—is complete in motion only because he is the sum of his ancestors and his condition his times.Do you often find that you can improve on what you've originally put downh yes yeshink any writer keeps at it until he knows that that's the best he can do.
It may not be good enough but when he realized that's the best he can do then he moves on to the next sentence or the next paragraph.That's not exactly whaeantean you say you write as fast as you can to get it out and then you go back and build up the constructions in there anNo no.
I—I didn't mean thatean that I—I don't like to—the mechanics of putting the stuff on paper anry to get it in shape in my mind beforake the—do the workidn't mean thacribble and then went back over it and—and edit it no.
It's—it's done as much as possible mentally until it begins to sound right.
Theut it down.
Yes sir.Sir in your writing you—you find you get very close to people and draw people as you think they are.
What do you think of the approach of men like Mencken and Shaw who really—or possibly I'm wrong buon't think they're trying to give the publiicture of people.
They're rather trying to slap them in the facittle bit and paint in extremes.
Well they were—were using the tools of their trade as they believed they were the best tools.
I—I think that—that—that Shaw was—was trying to write about human beings in the—in the light of his own intelligence and his own wit and his—his own distaste for certain conditionshink that Mencken was—was still a—a—a constantly angry indignant man more—he was first that.
He was only seconritic oociologist.
He was mainly jusad man.
Shaw of course wasn't.
Shaw was—was—was an artist.
Yes sir.You mentionehile ago in noting some of the books that you liked particularly Madame Bovary and also Tolstoyake from what you also said that the things you admire about these two very different artists would be the fact that they both hit the truth Flaubert in his extremely precisOh yes.Tolstoy in his almost shapeless way.
Would you—would you say something about your own preferences or attitudes toward the different extremes of craftsmanship in War and Peace as opposed to Bovaryell in Bovaraw or thoughaan who wasted nothing who was—whose approach toward his language was almost the lapidary's that he was—he—whether he had the leisure I—I don't know exactly for what the—what the terant—that ian who—who elected to do one book perfectly in the—in the characters and in the method in the style as—as againsan who was so busy writing about people that he didn't have much time to bother about style and when he did attain style he was just as astonished as anybody else.
Though that—that comparisorant you is—is better between Flaubert and Balzac maybe.
Well I—I think of the man that—that wrote Salammbo and the La Tentation de St. Antoine and Madame Bovary watylist who was also—had—had enough talent to write about people too.
But everybody can't do that.
Everybody can't do both.
You have to choose maybe what shalo?
Shalry to tell the truth about people or shalry to tell the truth in a—ihalice?
Does the luxuriance of the foliage in War and Peace offend your sense—sense of craftsmanshipo.
No nothing—I'm not enough oonscious craftsman to—to remember thaave ever been offended by—by any style or—or method.
That I—I think that—that the moment in—in the book the story demands its own style and seems to me just as natural as the moment in the year produces the leaf.
It's when Melville becomes Old Testament Biblical that seems natural to me.
When he becomes gothic that seems natural to me too anadn't—really hadn't stopped to think Now where does one change and become another?
Though with—with the Bovary it's as though you know from the very first as soon as you see what is going that he will never disappoint you that it would be as—as—as absolute as mathematics.You filled the full hound thank you.
Well we'll begin by askinuestions raise your hand if you have one.
Yes sir.
this is sort ouestion of motivation for the writer and many of the best southern writers write about the degeneration of the old aristocracy and its determination to live and to think according to the old traditions and standards.
Now do you think that this continued determination on the part of those around him causes the writer to revolt against this system and accordingly is it a—does this attitude does it furnish a—a motivation for writingt does in that that is a—a condition of environment.
It's something that is handed to the writer.
He is writing about people in the terms that he's most familiar with.
That is it could have sociological implications but he's not too interested in that.
He is writing about people.
He is using the material which he knows the tools which are at hand and so he uses the—the instinct or the desire or what—whatever you will call it of the old people to be reactionary and tory to stick to the old ways.
It's simplondition.
And since it iondition it lives and breathes and it is valid as material.
Yes sir.Sielieve you were in Europe in 1923 at the same time as Anderson and Hemingway and others.
At that time did you associate with them and if not was there any specific reason why you were not thrown together and do you think that that group was influenced or influenced each other in any way as—from their associationhey may have.
I—I think the artist is influenced by all in his environment.
He's maybe more sensitive to it because he's—has got to get the materials the lumber that he's going to build his edifice with.
I—at that timidn't think of myself ariteraramp then anidn't—audience laughteasn't interested in literature nor literary people.
They were—I was there at the same timenew Joyce—I knew of Joyce anould go to some effort to go to the café that he inhabited to look at him but that was the only literary man thaemember seeing in Europe in those days.
Yes sir.How did Sutpen get all his money in "Wedding for the—Wedding in the Rain"?
It was said that he got it by robbing showboathink but how did he get—hink that he looted his father-in-law's Caribbean plantationhink that—that his drive to—to revenge himself on the—on the man who had told him to go around to the back door by establishinynasty of his own and he was ruthless about it and he probably picked out the easiest money he could get and one quick way to get some of it was to marry the daughter.
Another quick way instead of waiting for the old man to die was to loot the plantation whichink he did and he probably brought it to the mainland and hid it and whenever he needed more money he would go and dig uittle more of it.
It was probably in bullion gold jewels maybe.
But I'm sure that's the way he got it.
Yes sir.
would you say that much writing is the result of unrest within the writer think it's alesult of unrest in the writerhink—think the writer is demon-driven that he can't be at peace unless he is—is trying to take the sorry shabby world which he finds and he can't change it physically so he can—can creatorld of his own in which people are—are braver or better blackguards or better heroes or more chaste or better villains than he finds in the world around him.
He's demon-drivehink.Is this ever really satisfying himes what satisfies him is the belief that this time he's going to create that world which will match the dream.
Of course it don't and so he writes another book tomorrow.
That one won't either and he'll write another one.
Maybe if he ever did write one that pleased him he would be miserable.
Nothing else to do.
Yes sir.Sir it has been argued that "A Rose for Emily" iriticism of the North and others have argued saying that it iriticism of the South.
Now could this story shall we say be more properly classified ariticism of the timeow thaon't know becausas simply trying to write about people.
The writer uses environment—what he knows—and if there'ymbolism in which the—the lover represented the North and the—and the—the woman who murdered him represents the Souton't say that's not valid and not there but it was no intention of the writer to—to say "Now let's see I'm going to writiece in whicill—will usymbolism for the North and another symbol for the South" that he was simply writing about peopltory which he thought was—was tragic and true because it—it came out of the—out of the human heart of human aspiration the human—the conflict of—of conscience with—with glands with the Old Adam.
It waonflict not between the North and South so much as between well you might say God and Satan.
Yes sir.Sir jusittle more on that thing.
You say it'onflict between God and Satan.
Welon't quite understand what—what you mean there.
Who is—did one represent the ...he conflict was—was in Miss Emily that she knew that you do not murder people.
She was—she had been trained that—that—that you do not takover you marry.
You don't takover.
She had broken all the—the—the laws of her tradition her background and she had finally broken the law of God too which says you do not take human life.
And she knew she was doing wrong and that's why her—her own life was wrecked.
Instead of having murdered one lover and then to go on and—and take another and when she used him up to murder him she was expiating her crime.
Yes ma'am.But can'erson like Miss Emily though she did do all the things that she had been taught not to and beinensitive sort ooman it was sure to have told on her but do you think it's fair to feel pity for her because iay she made her adjustment and it seemed to have wound up iappy sort oay—certainly tragic—but maybe it suited her just fine.
Yes it may have but theon't think that—that one should withhold pity simply because the—the subject of the pity object of the pity is pleased and satisfiedhink the—the pity is in—in the—the human striving against its own nature against its own conscience.
That's what deserves the pity.
It's not the fate of the individual.
It's man in conflict with his heart or with his fellows or with his environment.
That's—that's what deserves the pity.
It's not that the man suffered or that he fell off the house or was run over by the train.
It's that he was—that man is trying to do the best he can with his—his desires and impulses against his—his own moral conscience and the— the conscience of—the social conscience of—of his time and his place the—the little town he must live in the family he'art of.In "The Bearas theroeal Liones there wasan remember that dogas about the age of that little boy and he belonged to our pack of bear and deer dogs and he waomplete individualist.
He—he didn't love anybody.
The other dogs were all afraid of him.
He waavage.
But he—he did—did love to—to run the bear.
Yeemember him quite well.
He was mostly Airedale.
He had some hound and Lord only knows what else might've been in him.
He waremendous big brute stood about that high.
Must've weighed seventy-five or eighty pounds.
in any bear hunt that Lion participated in did he ever perform heroic action like the one in the storyo not really.
There'ase of the—the sorry shabby world that don't quite please you so you create one of your own so you—you make Lioittle braver than he was and you make the beaittle more the bear than he actually was.
I'm—I'm sure that Lion could have done that and—and—would have done it and it may be at times wheasn't there to record the—the action he did do things like that.
Yes sir.This question is also concerned with "The Bear."
In the conclusion of the story Ike McCaslin finds Boon destroying his rifle.
Noas wondering if this incident just showed that Boon could not so you say compete with the mechanical age or whether this was showing the end of an order the fact that Lion and that Old Ben were dead that the hunters weren't returning to the cabin any more and the land had been sold tumber company.ittle of both.
It was that Boon with the mentality of a—ohiloy of—of sixteen or seventeen couldn't cope not only with the mechanical age but he couldn't cope with any time.
Also it—to me it underlined the—the—the heroic tragedy of the bear and the dog by the last survival being reduced to the sort of—of petty comedy of someone trying to patch uun in order to shooquirrel.
That made the—the tragedy of—of the dog and the beaittle more poignant to me.
That's the sort of tour de force thahink the writer is entitled to use.
Yes sir.Sir the other day you said that you don't try to inject yourself intituation about which you're writing and—and feel how you might react if you werertain person.
You said you didn't do that.
Is it—do your characters—do their actions come about strictly from an—an unconscious feeling on your part or do they just flow out or I prefer to think that—that the characters are—are alive enough to stipulate and postulate their own behavior and actions that the actions of—of course they come from my own experience of people burefer to think that the characters by that time have taken charge of the story and that they're ones that are saying what they would do and what they will say that all they need then is—is someone to trot along and put it down.
That actually it wouldn't be to me much fun in inventing lay figures just to—to project my own ideas.
These idearant you are mine but—but they are the lumber in—in the attic that—that—in the carpenter's workshop.
Now and then he needoard so he reaches back and finds it and sure enough it fits.
That is he has to cut it and trim iittle but it fits.
Yes sir.I know that you've stated that you don't read the critics regarding your own work.
Howeveonder what ideas you have regarding the aims or the proper function oiterary critic not only of your works but shall we say of others as well would say he has a—a valid functioery important function but—but to me he'ood deal like the minister.
You don't need to listen to him unless you need him ann my own case  I—I knoave already decided about the value of my work.
There's nothing anybody can tell mon't know about it and the critic noither can improve it any by that time and the only way to improve it is to write one that will be better next time and so I'm at that anrobably just don't have time to read the critic.
Yes sir.Sir when you started to write did you write to—to say something to other people or did you write mostly for your own satisfactionecause it was funecamriter bhance.
I've told this story before some of you may have heard itas running whiskey foew Orleans bootlegger back in Prohibition days anet Sherwood Anderson aniked him from the first.
We would meet in the afternoons and we would walk around New Orleans and—and he would talk anould listen.
Then in the evening we would meet and we'd sit somewhere and drink and he would talk anould listen.
In the morning he would be in seclusion working and that went on day after day anhought that if that was whariter's life was that would be the life for me  and srotook and—and after the first day or twound out that writing was fun.
It was just about the nicest thing anybody could do anas having so much fun at it thaven forgot about  Andersonadn't seen him in oh several weeks anenderson on the street and she said "We haven't seen you in some time.aid "Yes'm I'm writinook."
Saw her again on the street and she said "I told Sherwood you were writinook and Sherwood said 'My God'"  anaw her later on.
She said "How's the book getting along said "I'm just about to finish it."
And she said "Do you want Sherwood to read it hadn't thought about anybody reading the thing because it was fun anaid "Yes'on't mind if he wants to" so she told him about itaw her again and she says "Sherwood says if he don't have to read it he'll makrade with you.
If he don't have to read it he'll tell his publisher to take it."
Said "Done."
And so he told  Liveright to take it and that's hoot published.
But by that time I'd found out that—that writing was fun to do and that that was simply my cup of tea and I've been at it since ever since.Yes ma'am.Did they take it just the way it was oYes'm.Now what would you have done if they had asked you to make changeselon't know becausad lost my bootlegging job or  the—I believe the—the Federal people finally caught him anad a—a job as an ordinary seaman ireighter thenas—I spent the next year or two in ships and by that timas working on another book and sas—got out of touch with this oneon't—I reckoould've changed it probably if the publisher had said "If you makew changes we'll print itrobably would.
Yes sir.Sihink you said that you haven't yet achieved your own personal goal ariter.
What is that goal and is it likely that you will succeed ... or achieving ithat's difficult to say.
It's—it's wheave done something that to use Hemingway's phrase makes me feel good that is—that is completely satisfactory.
Maybe that will be the goal anope jusittle that I'll never quite do that because io there won't be any reason to go on writing and I'm too old to take up another hobby.
It's—I—I think that—that a—a writer wants to—to make something that he knows that—that a—a hundred or two hundred or five hundrehousand years later will make people feel what they feel when they read Homer or read Dickens or Balzac Tolstoy.
That that's probably his goalon't think that he bothers until he gets old like this and has the right to spenot of time talking about it to put that into—into actual words but probably that's what he wants that really the writer doesn't want success that he knows he hahort span of life that the day will come when he must pass through the wall of oblivion and he wants to leavcratch on that wall "Kilroy was here" that somebodundred ohousand years later will see.
Yes sir.Sir why do you regard The Sound and the Fury as your best workt was the best failure.
It was the one that—thanguished the most over thaorked the hardest at that even wheneouldn't bring it oftill worked at it.
Like the parent feels toward the—the unfortunate child maybe.
The others—others that have been easier to write than that and in ways are better books than that buon't have the feeling toward any of them thao toward that one because that was the—the most gallant the most magnificent failure.
Yes sir.
you said that even though you did not bring it off you worked hardest at it.
How do you feel that you failed to bring The Sound and the Fury offt don't make me feel good enough to use Hemingway's phrase.
That's a—a condition that probablan't put into words but iver do strike iill know ithink that—that's true of any writer.Well aren't there parts of it that make you feel good enoughell that's not enough  parts of it are not enough.
It must be all you see.
You can't compromise you know.
It's—it's either good or it ain't.
There's no degrees of goodness.
It's either all right or it's not all right.
Yes sir.
how do you feel abouablehe Fable was—I don't have the same feeling toward that because the Fable waook that came out of an idea.
The others were—came out of people.
The Fable was an idea and at that timelt thaad learned enough about my craft to do it about as well as—as anyone could have done it and that's to matisfactory book but it—it—it doesn't move me like The Sound and the Fury did.
The Sound and the Fury is one book thaould like to write ovenoouldn't do it better.
But the Fable non't want to write that anymore.
Yes ma'am.Can you make any comment on the part that the old general plays iable?
He seemed to me to take two distinct different parts if not more in the theme of passion week including the three temptations.
Would you care to elaborate at all on that characterell to me he was the—the dark splendid fallen angel.
The good shining cherubim to me are not very interesting.
It's—it's the dark gallant fallen one that is moving to me.
He was an—an—an implement really.
Whaas—was writing about was the trilogy of man's conscience represented by the—the young British pilot officer the runner and the quartermaster general.
The one that said "This is—is dreadful terrible anon't face it even at the cost of my life."
That was the—the British aviator.
The old general who said "This is terrible but—but we can bear it."
The third one the battalion runner who said "This is dreadfuon't stand it I'll do something about it."
The old general was—was Satan who had been cast out of heaven and—because God himself feared him.Well what—the thing that had puzzled me was that going back as far aould gather he also had been the father of the corporal.
Yes that's right.And that is what had somewhat puzzled me in the allegoricaThat waart of—of Satan's fearsomeness that he could usurp the—the legend of God.
That was what made him so—so fearsome and so powerful that he could—could usurp the legend of God and then discard God.
That's why God feared him.
would you care to say anything about the allegorical function of the horse in the Fable?
He seems to have some very complex or interesting characteristics.
Not to me no.
That was simply another struggle between man and his conscience and his environment.
The horse was—was—simply a—a tool.
That is that—that foul and filthy Cockney hostler was still capable of love for something.
That if he had maybe—if he had—haetter—better childhooetter—better background he might've been capable of better love of something more worthy than—thaorse.
But he was capable of love for one thing that he could sacrifice to and could defend even though it was onlorse.Yes ma'am.In the story "Red Leaves" in the Indian burial ritual would it have brought disgrace to that had the man-servant committed suicide during the chaseell me that again.
During the —In the—in the short story "Red LeavesYenow.During the burial the burial rituaYes.Would it have brought disgrace to that whole ritual had the man-servant committed suicide during the chase before they caught himo they could still have—have brought his body back and immolated that.
No they were simply cleaning house.
That was what the rule said when the chief went back to the earth his—his body servant and his dogs and his horse went with him.
No it would have been no disgrace.
It—in fact if he had done that quicker they would've been pleased because it would have saved them all the trouble of tracking him back and forth through that swamp which they didn't want to do.
They werazy indolent people and there wasn't any use of anyone causing all that trouble when he couldn't get away.
Yes sir.What is your purpose in writing into the first section of The Sound and the Fury passages that seem disjointed within themselves the ideas not connected with one anotherhat was part of the failure.
It seemed to me that—that the book approached nearer the dream if—if the groundwork of it was laid by the idiot who was incapable of relevancy.
That's—I agree with you too that'ad method but to me it seemed the best way to do it that I—I shifted those sections back and forth to see where they went best but my final decision was that though that was not right that was the best to do it that it was simply the—the groundwork of that story as that idiot child saw it.
He himself didn't know what he was seeing that the only thing that—that held him into any sort of reality into the world at all was—was the trust that he had for—for his sister that he knew that she loved him and would defend him and so she was—was the—the whole world to him and these things were flashes that were reflected on her as iirror.
He didn't know what they meant.
Yes sir.You spokinute ago of the writer seeking to leave some creative mark on—on posterityas wondering if you think that the effect on the artist is better today when he can somehow achieve his immorality—immortality during his lifetime because the communication being so much wider and greater than formerly when perhaps the writer's fame came to him long after his death and maybe he was the only one during his lifetime that was satisfied with his work don't think soelieve the writer takeonger view than that.
He ain't too interested in—in what the contemporary world thinks about it.
He haonger view that—he—he is aimed not at—at Jones of 1957 but at Jones of 2057 or 4057.Well do you think that the—the—you would have been just as satisfied if your work maybe had never been discovered until 4057 think so sure.
Yes.
Of course the—when they began to bring iittle money that was nice.
I—I liked the money but the—the glory the rest of it's not very valuable.
Yes ma'am.Well then thinking that this period doesn't matter too much do you go back over the things and you still havot of time left to work over the ones that you've already written.
Do you go back and worry about them and wish you had done them differently wisad done them better buon't have time to worry about it too much.
That's jusonstant—thought or—or belief that—thaould like to be able to do them over again.
That is not to—to go back and take one single book and write a—another version of it but iould go back to say 1920 whetarted thaould detter job.
Of coursouldn't but that's an idle thought that—that occurs only wheaven't gotten anything better to do.
The—the best thing is to—to write another book to do it.
Because it takes only one book to do it.
It's not the sum oot of scribbling.
It's— it's one perfect book you see.
It's—it's one—one single urn or shape that you want to do.
Yes sir.
you said that when you wrote the Fable that you—you had an idea and you made the characters develop the plot through that and that you did that because you thought you knew your trade well enough by that time to do that.
Now does that mean that when you first start out that you think that it's better to make the characters shape the plot and sort of let it unfold as— do yes.
Unless you have a—an extremely interesting and moving idea which to mhoughad in the Fable—was the—the thought Just suppose that had been Christ under the cenotaph with the eternal fire burning and—and all the—the temporarily well-known world figures to come and put a—a wreath of moribund flowers on it.
Suppose that had been Christ crucified again.
That would be twice and would we have another chance?
But it's beshink for the writer to write about people.
That's—that's your trade you know.
Your craft is to write about people.
They're infinitely interesting.
They're infinitely capable of diversion of change of aberrations.
Yet they're intrinsically the same thing.
It's the same heart the same anguish the same desire to be better than you are the same passion that the—the heart feels the same ambition aspiration hope.
That's what you're writing about.
Yes'm.When you do write about people that way—well of course you don't have to put up with the critics buoticed particularly that wheew book comes out all these Freudian implications are pulled out and all sorts of undercurrents rather than just the simple here's what happened and—and of course there's always more to it than that but all kinds of weird things are just pulled out of the hat and thrown around.
Does that bother you?
Does it disturb you that everything is sort of misconstrued can't say because I'm not aware of iton't—don't read the—the criticson't know any literary people.
The peoplnow are—are other farmers and—and horse people and hunters and we talk about horses and dogs and—and guns and—and—and what to do about this hay crop or this cotton crop not about literature.
I—I think I'm convinced though that—that sort of criticism whether it's—it's nonsensical or not is valid because it is a—a symptom of—of—of change or motion which is life.
And also it'roof that—that literature art is a—iiving quantity in our social condition.
If it were not then there—there'd be no reason for people to—to—to delve and find all sorts of symbolisms and psychological strains and currents in it.
And I'm quite sure that there are some writers to—to whom that criticism is good that it could help them find themselveson't know that the critic could—could teach the writer anything because I'm inclined to think that—that nobody really can teach anybody anything that you offer it and it's there and if—and if it is your will or urge to learn it you do and the writer that does need the criticism can get quitot of benefit from it.
Yes sir.
in "That Evening Sun" is the ditch symbolical of the color lineould be but you see I—  ... Then he will need observation.
He uses that buon't believe that—that he—he himself knows or has time to know just how much of which was where and when.
Yes ma'am.
when you were out in Hollywood did you have anything to do with televising some of your stories?eard that you .... Now they have been televised haven't theyes every now and then I—I hear about oneon't havadio and television son't keep up with what goes on buear now and then that they have been on TV.
Yes sir.Sir what are the spotted horses symbolic of if anythings spotted horseon't know.
I—that—that may be symbolical but as horses that was—was—they—they symbolized the—the hope the aspiration of—of the masculine part of society that is capable of—of doing of—of committing puerile folly for some gewgaw that—that has drawn him as juxtaposed to the cold practicality of—of the women whose spokesmaittlejohn was when she said "Them men!"
or "What fools men are!"
That the man even iociety where there'onstant pressure to conform can still be taken off by the chance to buorse for three dollars.
Which to me iood sighinkope that man can always be tolled off that way to—to buorse for three dollars.
Yes ma'am.
what sort of reading do you best enjoy?
Do you have much time for the work of contemporary novelistson'taven't reaontemporary book in twenty-odd years unless someone says "This iood bookhink you would like it" and sill get that book and read it but I've got out of the habit of keeping up with—with contemporaries becausever was a—a literary man in the sense of—of—of needing to keep abreast of the establishment of literature.
To me reading is like writing—I do it for fun.
I'm not too interested in—in what anybody else has done thaead books because it's fun.How about the classicshe classics?ead the books thaiked wheirst began to read and they are—yes what ranks as classics now meaning by that any book that people still read afteundred or two years.
Yes sir.Sir could you suggest any books that one read first in order to gelearer and more comprehensive picture of your complete works and if there are any why these specific choiceshere are nonehink the best way to read—nan't say the best way this is the waeadake the book anan tell within two or three pages iant to read that book now.
Ion'ut that dowake anotherould say to take  that—that same way and reaage or two until you find one that you want to read another page.
It would be difficult for anyone except an expert to—to plot ouchedule for youould do it that wahink.
Yes sir.Sir do you have any solution foan to find peace if he cannot write as youelon't think the writer finds peace.
If he did he would—he would quit writing.
Maybe man is incapable of peace.
Maybe that is what differentiates man froegetable.
Though maybe the vegetables don't even find peace.
Maybe there's no such thing as peace that it is a—a negative quality that —Annderstandm speaking of peace in his own heart.
Yes well I'm—I'm inclined to think that the only peace man knows is—is he says "Why good gracious yesterdaas happy."
That at the moment he's—he's too busy.
That maybe peace is—is onlondition in retrospect when the—the subconscious has—has gotten rid of—of the—the—the gnats and the tacks and the broken glass in experience and has left only the—the peaceful pleasant things.
That was peace.
Maybe peace is not "is" but "was."
Yes ma'am.Do you enjoy reading Shakespeare?eard you speak of Homeras just wondering how you felYes'mtill read Shakespeareavne-volume Shakespeare thaave just about worn out carrying around with me.
Yes sir.hink you told somebody once that if you had a—you were writing something and you had something to get up to every morning and go to work on you'd never have to be afraid of anything in the world any more.
Anonder what you meant by that.ean by that that out of idleness that if you have something to—to get up to tomorrow morning you're too busy to pay much attention to fear.
Of course you—you have the fears but you have—you don't have time to—to take them too seriously if you have something to get up to do tomorrow.
It don't matter too much what it is.
And if it's something that you yourself believe is valid in the sense that the artist believes what he's doing is valid in that it may do something to uplift man's heart not to make man any more successful but to temporarily make him feel better than he felt before to uplift his heart fooment.
Yes sir—oh yes ma'am.In "The Bears the possession and destruction of the wildernesymbolic indication of any sort of corruption in the South?
And if this is true what sort of prognostication does this have for the future of the South or of the country aholeell of course the destruction of the wilderness is nohenomenon of the South you know.
That is a—a change that's going on everywhere and I—I think that—that man progresses mechanically and technically much faster than he does spiritually that there may be something he could substitute for the ruined wilderness but he hasn't found that.
He spends more time ruining the wilderness than he does finding something to replace it just like he spends more time producing more people than something good to do with the people or to make better people out of them.
That that's to me is a—a sad and tragic thing for the—for the old days the old times to go providing you have the sort of background whicountry boy like me had when that waart of my life.
Thaon't want it to—to change but then that's true of everyone as he grows old.
He thinks that—that the old times were the best times and he don't want it to change.
Yes sir.Is your short story "Death Drag" based on an actual event or experience in your lifeot too much.
They were—I diittle what they call barnstorming in the early days after the War when aeroplanes were not too usual and people would paundred dollars to be taken fohort ride in one buon't remember anything that was specifically like this.
This was agaiuman being in conflict with his environment and his time.
This man who hated flying but that was what he had to do simply because he wanted to makittle money.
Yes sir.What symbolic meaning did you give to the dates of The Sound and the Furyow there'atter of hunting around in the carpenter's shop to finool that will maketter chicken-house.
And probably—I'm sure it was quite instinctive thaicked out Easter but thaasn't writing any symbolism of the Passion Week at allust—that waool that was good for the particular corneas going to turn in my chicken-house and ssed it.
Yes sir.Sir you mentioned some of the Russian authors before.
What do you think of Dostoevsky?
Do you consider him one of the beste's one that has not only influenced mot but thaave goreat deal of pleasure out of reading antill read him again every year or so.
That as a—a craftsman as well as—as his insight into people his capacity for compassion.
He was one of the ones that any writer wants to—to match if he can.
That's—he wane that— wrotood "Kilroy Was Here."
Yes sir.There'ine in "Was" thaonder if you would explain something about it that Tomey's Turl says to Cass.
"Anytime you wants to get something done from hoeing ourop to getting married just get the women-folks to working at it.
That all you needs to do—then all you needs to do is set down and wait."
Well that's good advice but does he use it in this story?
Does Tomey's Turl get the women folks to work for himell I'm sure he would if he'd had time but people were—were running him with dogs so much and harrying and harassing from pillar to post he didn't have time but if he could have—could've got the men to stop long enough then Miss Sophonsiba would have settled that whole thing.
She would have taken Uncle Buck home and then Tomey's Turl and Tennie could have gotten married and things would have been settled.
It was the men that kept things stirred up.
Probably Tomey's Turl knew that soon as the dust settled no matter what was the outcome of that poker game Miss Sophonsiba and Uncle Buck would get married and that then he and Tennie would be let alone.
Yes ma'am.
is Requiem foun going to be put on alayt has been knocking around Europe for about five years.
I—I wrote that not alay but as another of the carpenter's tools which seemed to me the best way to teltory.
There waoung woman.
She was a—a—a frienweetheart of—of my youngest brother's thanew of vaguely around home in Oxford and she's trying to be an actress and so she asked me to let her do it alay save her the rights to it and that's why it has never been in the States because she hasn't got enough reputation for anyone to put up the money thalay in this country costs.
It wilssume reach here in time sooner or later.But you haven't got any idea of your own about how it should be put on or whether there should bhorus usedo'm I'm nolaywright and I—I never saw but three or four plays in my life.
Yes sir.I wonder if you could comment on who you think in say two hundred years from now will leave the biggest "Kilroys Were Here."
Of this century which writers will leave the biggest "Kilroy" if any don't want to answer that question because I'm too unfamiliar with—with contemporary writersaven't read any contemporaries since the—the three or four of my time and so ofteemark like that in simple talk it gets out and someone's feelings have been hurt that the man that spoke it had no intention of hurting because he didn't even know he existed and so for that reason I— audience laughteouldn't answer that question at all.
I—I would say that—thahink that—that Sherwood Anderson has not received the recognition that he deserves and some day will have.What about Hemingwayemingway now he's—he's alive and that—that's where I'd better stay out of trouble by saying nothing you see.Would you say anything about your own writings—or would you hurt your own feelingstill haven't done it buntend to live to be abouundred years old so I've got forty more years yet.
By that time I'll answer your question if you're still around.
Thank you very muchpplause  ...questions having to do with his own work and on anything that people want to consider about the problems of writing in general.
It would help everybody in the roohink if each questioner spoke up not only for  ’s hearing but for everyone else’s.
.Siome from India and I've been trying to reaood many of your books.
The problem finding it extremely difficult to follow the narrative method that you adopt.
Is it true to say that you adopyrical method tarrative anovel is alsarrative of certain events and what the characters do what happens to them?
We find that iovel like Aay Dying or The Sound and the Fury or the Sanctuary that it's difficult to follow the event.
Is it true to say that you follow the lyrical method while trying to teltory?
Aorrecthink the writer is concerned first in telling about people people in conflict with themselves and with others with their environment and he uses whatever method seems to him the best to tell what he is trying to tell in the most dramatic and passionate way that he is not trying to usyrical method deliberately.
It may seem to him best to usyrical method or maybe the result of—of his own agony and anguish to say what he wants to say becomes lyrical.
Yes ma'am.Who is the central character of Absalom Absalom!?
It seems so obviously to be Sutpen yet it's been said that it's also the story of Quentin anas wondering just who is the central characterhe central character is Sutpen yes.
The story oan who wanteon and got too many got so many that they destroyed him.
It's incidentally the story of—of Quentin Compson's hatred of the—the bad qualities in the country he loves.
But the central character is Sutpen the story oan who wanted sons.
Yes sir.Sir in the same booas wondering what is supposed to be the reader's attitude towards  Coldfield the father of Ellenell my attitude is that he was a—a pretty poor manon't know what the reader's attitude might be butill felt compassion and pity for him but he waoor man in my opinion.
Yes sir.Sir what sort oeal was made between Goodhue Coldfield and Sutpen in reference to the bill of lading?
It looked like they pulled some sort of deal.on't remember.
That book is so long ago to me but—but Coldfield was a—a petty grasping man and Sutpen was a—a bold ruthless man and Sutpen used Coldfield's pettiness for his Sutpen's ends buon't remember exactly what it wasYes sir.Sir in Light in August the central character Joe Christmas had most of his troubles and his persecutions and in his search to find himself was based on his belief that he was part Negro and yet it's never made really clear that he is.
Was he supposed to be part Negro or was this supposed to add to the tragic irony of the story think that was his tragedy.
He didn't know what he was and so he was nothing.
He—he deliberately evicted himself from the human race because he didn't know which he was.
That was his tragedy.
That to me was the—the tragic central idea of the story that he didn't know what he was and there was no way possible in life for him to find out which to me is the most tragic conditioan could find himself in not to know what he is and to know that he will never know.Sir if—if he is not—does not definitely have Negro blood well what is the significance of Gavin Stevens's surmise there at the end when he explains that there'onflict of blood?
That that is onluess that stands fouess and noinal knowledge oYes yes that is—is an assumptioationalization which Stevens made.
That is the people that destroyed him made rationalizations about what he was.
They decided what he was.
But Christmas himself didn't know and he evicted himself from mankind.
Sir when in Absalom Absalom!
after the killing of Charles Bon Clytie tries to keep Rosa Coldfield from—from coming in does Clytie realize that Charles Bon is her own half-brother?
Is that the reason that she's trying to keep Rosa out do you think?
Does she feel any relationship don't rememberon't remember that.
Let me thininute.
I—I don't remember whether Clytie was any relation to Charles Bon's mother.
That's so long ago too.They have the same father.
Well then yes that would be the reason of course.
do you think thaomparison can justly be made between Joe Christmas and Charles Bon's son?
Is there much in their behavior you think that's similarhere again you have meon't remember.
They're both so long ago and that's one good thing about beinriter.
You can get rid of one book you don't have to read again.
Yes sir.In working out the situation of Joe Christmas did you deliberately have in minorrespondence between his situation and Oedipus for example as has recently been brought out in an essay published in the Quarterly magazineo not deliberately and not consciously.
That's another matter of the writer reaching back into the lumber room of his memory for whatever he needs to—to create the character or the situation.
The—and the—the similarity is there but it was not by deliberate intent.
It was by—by coincidence not accident but by coincidence.
Yes sir.Along those same lineoticeimilarity between Sutpen and Heathcliff from Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights anas wondering if there's any intentional similarities here at all don't knowon't know Wuthering Heightsever read it.Thank you.
in Wild Palms there iassage strongly reminiscent of the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov the import of which seems to condemn not Christ but organized religion.
In Light in August much of the action seems to stem from almost fanatical Calvinism.
Would it be true to surmise that you favor strongly individual rather than an organized religion do always.Then you think perhaps that man must work out his own salvation from within rather than without do yes.
Yes sir.Siave often wondered through what process the author actually goes when he writeook.
Could you briefly outline what process you go through?
Nonoan't.
I'm—I'm lazyate to—the mechanics of putting the words down on paper ano as much of it as possible in my headill—that is putting it down on paper is the last resort.
I've got to get it out of my system and son't know what systeight use mentally to get the—the facts in order to—to bring the—the mass of material into the—the—the form according to the rules of—of unity and emphasis.
I—I just don't know.
Some people work from notes.
They—they make notes and then correlate the notes and then edit and then write and then do a—a drafton't do thatry my best not to have to change anything because I'm lazhink thaon't like to work.How many times do you rewrite the ... hundreds of draftsometimes the first one is all right.
Sometimeill do three or four or five until it comes right buill try my best not to do it but once becausate to work.
Yes ma'am.In another class you stated that you seldom have the plot of your novels worked about before you begin to write but that they simply develop from a—froharacter or an incidentas wondering if you remember what character or what incident caused you to write Absalom Absalom!utpen.You thought about the characteYes the—the idea oan who—who wanted sons and got sons who destroyed him.
The—the other characterad to get out of the attic to tell the story of Sutpen.
Yes sir.
do you ever consciously base your—any of your characters either major characters or minor characters on people you find in every-day life.
For example during your time spent in Charlottesville could you possibly incorporate someone who lived here into one of your major books aonscious exercise will very likely do it but not aonscious exercise.
The writer is completely amoral.
He—he will use experience.
He will rob from other writers.
He will take from life but he is—is trying to creatharacter of his own and so very likely in timill—will need someonave seen in Charlottesville Virginia and will without any compunction use him.
Yes sir.I've been looking for Sutpen's—the reason for Sutpen's downfalnd it seems to me that the Civil War playart in it.
Is that—is that truees.But that's not—that's not the main reasono this—I used the Civil War to—for my own ends there.
Sutpen—Sutpen's country was wrecked by the Civil War but that didn't stop Sutpen.
He was still trying to get the son still trying to establisynasty.
He was still trying to get even with that man who in his youth had said "Go to the back door."
Yes sir.Sir in Light in August much of the action comes back to the scene or the picture oolumn of yellow smoke coming up from Joanna Burden's cabinas wondering—you had said that in Sound and the Fury you got the idea for the story from seeinittle girl like Caddy ireeas wondering if that happened with Light in August.
Perhaps that was the scene that you had seen and that you started from in that story.
No that story began with Lena Grove the idea of—of—of the young girl with nothing pregnant determined to find her sweetheart.
It was—that was out of my—my admiration for women for the courage and endurance of women.
Aold that storad to get more and more into it but that was mainly the story of Lena Grove.
Yes sir.In Absalom Absalom!
what was the significance of Sutpen pitting himself against his Negro servants the wild Negro servants and especially in that scene where Ellen happened in when he had brought the children there to watch it?
Was that another example of the decadence of the Southo not—not by intent.
That was—was another instance of Sutpen's ruthlessness of his will his implacable will to creatynasty and fill it with sons and I—I thought of—of rather these which seemed to me dramatic or—or amusing or tragic incidents invented themselves as props for Sutpen's will implacable will to get the son.
Yes sir.In Sanctuars the character of Popeye emblematic of evil iaterialistic society or what would he stand foro he was to me another lost human being.
He became a—a symbol of evil in modern—modern society only by coincidence buas still writing about people not about ideas not about symbols.Sir I've been told that the title of Light in August came froolloquialism for the completion oregnancy.
Is that truesed it because in my country in August there's a—a—a peculiar quality to light and that's what that title means.
It has in a—a sense nothing to with the book at all the story at all.
Yes ma'am.How do you pronounce the name of your mythical countyf you break it down into syllables it's simple.
Y-o-k n-a p-a t-a-w p-h-a YOK-na-pa-TAW-pha.
It'hickasaw Indian word meaning water runs slow through flat land.
Yes ma'am.
what was the particular significance of having—of having Wash Joneery humble man be the instrument through which Sutpen met his death?
Is that to relate back to the social stratum from which Sutpen himself came and have therort of ironic effect?
Just what was the idea of thatense.
In another sense Wash Jones represented the man who survived the Civil War.
The—the aristocrat in the columned house was ruined but Wash Jones survived it unchanged.
He had been Wash Jones before 1861 and after 1865 he was still Wash Jones and Sutpen finally collided with him.
Yes sir.Sir in some of your stories you've used scenes wherein two or more people are sitting around or across from each other aable oesk iery dark room where perhaps only the hands can be seen in the lightingas wondering if that sort of scene meant anything to you or that you felt that you could use that particular scene foertain type of information in your story or just what think maybe instinctivelike understatement.
Maybe I—I haveeling for—for somberness.
Probablo but I—I do like to—to tell things as simply by—by understatement to—to tell—to show just the—the surface with—with the dark implications behind it of an instance or scene.Yes sir.Do you believe that the South of today is the South of people like Wash Jones and the Snopes clan or do you think—do you still think there's noble blood there think that it's mostly the—the South of Wash Jones and Snopeses but there's—there's a—the—the something left by the—the—the older braver people that appears now and then but it'ountry mainly of Snopeses and Wash Joneses.
They survived.
The—the quality that was left by the—the old brave aristocratic people shows occasionally.
Nobody knows where it might—when it might appear or where from.
Yes ma'am.In Light in August do you feel that Reverend Hightower dies feeling that he has achieveertain kind of salvation received some sort of salvation He didn't die.
He had—had wrecked his life.
He had failed his wife.
He had failed himself but there was one thing that he still had which was—was the—the—the brave grandfather that—that galloped into the town to burn the Yankee stores and at least he had that.
Everything else was gone but since he had been a—a—a man of God he still tried to ban of God and he could not destroy himself.
But he had—had destroyed himself but he still couldn't take his own life.
He had to—to endure it to live but that was one thing that was—was pure and fine that he had was the—the memory of his grandfather who had been brave.
Yes ma'am.So much of the story in Absalom Absalom!
is reconstructed by Shreve and Quentin.
How does the reader know which to accept as objective truth and which to consider juseflection of their personalitiesell the—the story was told by Quentin to Shreve.
Shreve was—was the—the comment—the commentator that held the thing to—to something of reality.
If Quentin had been let alone to tell it it would have—have become completely unreal.
It had to have a—a—a solvent to keep it real keep it believable creditable.
Otherwise it would have vanished into—to smoke and fury.
Sir along that same line you mentioned at the English Club that you had had to lay aside Absalom at one point and then resume it later ononder if it might not have been the point where—toward the end of Miss Rosa's section where you might have felt that she was running away with you because right after that Shreve comes in.
Is that in your memory at all sir can't say just where it was thaad to put it down thaecideidn't know enough at that time maybe or—or my feeling toward it wasn't passionate enough or pure enough buon't remember at what poinut it down.
Though wheook it up agailmost rewrote the whole thinghink that whaut down were inchoate fragments that wouldn't coalesce and then wheook it up again I—aemembeewrote it.
There's no break in style at that—no break in style at that point but the change in characters and point of view ....  That's possible but I—I don't remember just how much of the firsewrote wheegan the second time.Yes sir.I would like to ask you to identifuality for mem thinking oentence toward the end of "The Bear.m going to read part of the sentence so that you will understand wham asking about.
"There waoy who wished to learn humility and pride in order to become skillful and worthy in the woods.
He suddenly found himself becoming so skillful so rapidly that he feared that he would never become worthy because he had not learned humility."
Then finally it goes on "until an old man who could not have defined either had led him as though by the hand to that point where an old bear anittle mongrel oog showed him that by possessing one thing other he would possess them both."
What is that "one thing other"ourage.Thank you very much.
That was the little dog that —Yesondered if it was pity or truthCourage it was.
The little dog that—that never saear bigger than he was.
Yes ma'am.Is the title of Absalom Absalom!
taken from the passage in the Bible found in Second Samueles.Did you write the novel with this episode in your mind or did you first write the novel and then realizing the similarity of the namThey were simultaneous.
As soon ahought of the idea of the—of the man who wanted sons and the sons destroyed him thehought of the title.
Yes ma'am.Did you expect to writny more poetry?
And if so are there any particular subjects you'd like to see in your poetry'ailed poetonsider myselailed poet.
I've tried to boet anouldn't bood one and sid the next best thing whicould do but I'm still a—a failed poet but wharite is—is in my opinion poetry.
Yes sir.
what do you consider your best bookhe one that—that failed the most tragically and the most splendidly.
That was The Sound and the Fury—the onorked at the longest the hardest that was to me the—the most passionate and moving idea and made the most splendid failure.
That's the one that's my—I consider the best not—well best is the wrong word—that's the one thaove the most.I wanted to ask something about that.
Was it very difficult to write the stream-of-consciousness part of Benjamino no.
Not—not oncnderstood Benjy and understood the story.
It was very simple very easy.That's sucifficult part to understand unless someone shows yoNo it was very easy to do.
That's probably why it's so hard to readhink anything that is easy to do is—is per se probably bad  buouldn't think of any better way to tell about Benjyas trying to teltoryried that way.
That wasn't enoughried with Quentin.
That wasn't enoughried with Jason.
That still wasn't enough.
And theried  and that still wasn't enough.
It still failed and that's whove it.Sir.Most people are very struck by your change of style in Light in August.
For example you use the present tense to tell the story in rather than the past.
Was that—did you mean something by that or were you just usinew form for dramatic import o   No that just seemed to me the best way to tell the story.
It wasn'eliberate change of styleon't know anything about styleon't—I thinriter with—witot to—pushing inside him to get out hasn't got time to bother with style.
If he just likes to write and hasn't got anything urging him then he can becomtylist but the ones with a—a great deal pushing to get out don't have time to be anything but clumsy like Balzac for instance.Yes sir.In Absalom Absalom!
when Shreve and Quentin are reconstructing the story for each other they set uawyer who was directing the campaign of Charles's mother to gain revenge against Sutpen.
Was there reallawyer do you think or is it jusroduct of their imagination as they reconstructed the story'm sorron't remember that.They speak about the man who was counseling Charles's mother in trying to get back at Sutpen.
There probably waawyeron't remember that book but yes yes there waawyer.
That sounds too logical in Mississippi terms.
Yes he was—there would have been lawyer there.
Yes sir.Sir what is your personal reaction to situations such as being ilassroom when you discover thaot of people who've read into your novels things that you didn't intend them to readnterest.
audience laughteidn't know about all these things and so I'm quite interested to hear that they were in there.
They must've been in there for people to find them.Do you feel that perhaps you've failed in—in just plain telling your story or that perhaps you've done more than you realized ...o to me it wasn't told as well as it should've been told and that's whrite another one.
The one that—thaave finished that's—that's water under the bridge and I'm not interested any longer because that wasn't good enough.Is there any purpose in the repetition of the same types of characters throughout your writingo only thaave led a—all of my life has been lived iittle Mississippi town and there's not much variety there.
A—a writer writes from his experience his—his background in the terms of his imagination and his observation.
That would be the explanatiohink.
Yes sir.Sir in line with that some of your novels pick up the characters where you left them off in other novels that you had writteood number of years before.
For example most of the incidents involving the Snopes anderstand it were written from 1929 on and yet you've come out witook this year about the Snopes.
Do you find it difficult to oveeriod of years pick up those characters and carry their personalities through along the same veino no those characters to me are—are quite real and quite constant.
They are in my—my mind all the timeon't have any trouble at all going back to pick up one.
I—I forget what they did but—but the character I—I don't forget and when the book is finished that character is not done he's still going on at some new devilment that sooner or lateill find out about and write about.
Yes ma'am.It's been said that you write about the secret of the human heart.
Is there one major truth of the human heartell that'uestion almost metaphysicalould say if there is one truth of the human heart it would be to believe in itself believe in its—its capacity to aspire to be better than it is it might be.
That it does exist in all people.
Yes sir.Sir it has been said that at certain points in the evolution of society an author is within the society describing his immediate surroundings and what he sees at that time but as that society degrades and goes down the author is thrown out and looks as an outsider on his society such that you might see when you look at the South ...?
What do you feel is your position in society today?
Are you looking from within or are you out of the society looking at it objectively the South in particular think that I'm stilart of societyhink that arow oldenow more anee more understand more of whaee bum as much involved in society aas wheaoung manust—just know more of whaee now because I'm older.
Yes ma'am.
in light of the question out here and your answer about writing about Jefferson because that's what you know I've always been interested in why you switched then to France witable which is another treatment of the human heart?
Why did you feel thauropean setting would be best for that themehe Fable was the only boover wrote on an idea and the idea was who might that man be under the splendid cenotaph with the eternal fire burning over him?
That if he had been Christ returned again and crucified again for the second time then maybe we would have only one more chance.
That was the only boover wrote from an idea and that idea had to—since the idea was who might be under that cenotaph it had to take place in France.
Sir.Sir on the inside of the cover oablead the comment that this work might possibly becomlassic in the lifetime of the authorever finished the book and son't have an opinion of it to comment.
Do you care to comment don't think it's a—a very good book because it's—aay that's the only boover tried to write on ideas and I'm not an idea man.
I'm not a—a cerebral manrite from—from—from here and son't consider thaery good book myself.
It was the besould do with the idea anad to write it because the idea worried me.
Yes sir.I was wondering whether Charles Bon in Absalom Absalom!
ever had concluded who his father was Sutpen—hink he knewon't know whether he—his mother probably told himhink he knew.Was ionscious knowledge would you say or an unconscious knowledgerobably it—it was a—a conscious knowledge in the sense that his mother had told him who his father was.
It may be that he didn't believe it or didn't know or didn't carehink—I don't believe that he felt any affinity with Sutpen as father and son but probably his mother had told him and—that she had been deserted and if anything if he did believe it he hated Sutpen of course.
Yes sir.Sir do you think—according to Nathaniel Hawthorne the greatest sin was the violation of the human heart.
Would you say that you think along those lines as far as what the greatest sin could be or the greatest crimharacter could commit?
Would you agree with that statementes yegree with that.
Sir did you feel any connection between the servant Nancy in Requiem foun and the servant Nancy in "That Evening Sun"he is the same person actually.
They both have that incident about  Stovall in the street.
Yes she is the same personal actually.
These peopligure belong to me anave the right to move them about in time wheeed themYes sir.
throughout your work there seems to bheme that there'urse upon the Southas wondering if you could explain what this curse is and if there's any chance of the South of escaping it.
The—the curse is slavery which is a—a—an intolerable condition.
No man shall be enslaved and the South has got to work—work that curse out and it will if it's let alone.
It—it can't be compelled to do it.
It—it must do it of its own will and—and desire whicelieve it will do if it's let alone.Sir along that line how will it do it and what will it do to adjust its relationship with the Negro?
Will it take the Negro into society or what will ...o it will—it will never take the Negro into society.
It will give the Negro the right for equality which to me is something different.
It will—will teach the Negro the responsibility of equality of the—the Negro's own people will teach him that.
Then he will—will receive equality.
He—I think that the Negro doesn't want to mix with the white man any more than the white man wants to mix with the Negro buo think that the Negro wants to be equal with the white man and have the right to that once—once he has the same right to enter the white man's house that—that another white man does he won't want to that his—his grief is that he knows that he has not that right.
No matter how clean he is or how intelligent he has not that right to enter the white man's restaurant the white man's hotel.
Once he has that right he won't want to.
He'll prefer his owelieve.
Yes sir.Sir so many of your books have certain characters of mixed blood.
Do you consider miscegenation absolute—an absolute wrong or is it jusistake with the current social ...t's—no not wrong.
It'istake only in the current social scheme.
There's—there's no law that is going to—to prevent Romeo and Juliet no matter what color they are.
There's no wrong in it.
It's simplistake and an error as conditions are now and an individual suffers because of it.
That's the tragedy of it.
Yes sir.In Absalom Absalom!
... reaction to Sutpen's marriage because of their concern for their ... because there's ...'m sorryouldn't hear that too well.Was the reaction of the people to Sutpen's second marriage when they had—no one showed up at the wedding ...—was that reaction caused by people's—the people's dislike of his life or his social errors or because of their not being told why—where he got his money ...h he had violated the local mores.
They—they feared him and they hated him because of his ruthlessness.
He made no pretence to be anything else except what he was and so he violated the local mores and they—they ostracized him.
Not in revenge at all but simply because they wanted no part of Sutpen.
Yes sir.
you say that you feel that there is hope for the South yet the Snopeses have taken over Frenchmen's Bend Flem is president of the bank in Jefferson.
Are those the men that are going to lead the South out of the darkness in ...hey are the—the men that can cope with the new industrial age but there will be something left as this—we mentionehile ago of—of the old cavalier spirit that will appear that does appear.
I—by cavalier spiriean people who believe in—in simple honor for the—for the sake of honor and honesty for the sake of honesty.
Yes ma'am.Do you think those people will band together or how do you think they will accomplish this feat?
Don't you feel that—that there iurse and that it should be removed?
How do you feel that they will eventually overcomehey—they won't band togetheroubt if people accomplish very much by banding together.
People accomplish things by individual protest.
Yes sir.Is Sutpen meant to bompletely depraved character something like Claggart in Billy Budd or Iago in Othello or is he meant to be pitiedo me he is to be pitied.
He was not—depraved.
He was—was amoral.
He was ruthless completely self-centered.
To me he is to be pitied as anyone who ignores man is to be pitied who does not believe that he belongs aember of—ouman family of the human family is to be pitied.
Sutpen didn't believe that.
He was Sutpen.
He was going to take what he wanted because he was big enough and strong enough anhink that people like that are destroyed sooner or later because one has got to belong to the human family and to takesponsible part in the human family.
Yes ma'am.If you were to explain mechanization in the South after the Civil War aestructive force part of the degeneration do you think this is inherent of mechanization iociety when it shifts from an agrarian society or do you think this is because aerson in the South that it is this way in the Southell the South is—iart of the United States anhink that—that we are—the whole world is going through a—a tragic time now not because of mechanization but because we became slaves to—to the machines—at—which we invented for man's good.
Instead of they being our slaves we are their slaves.
And we will have to—but man is tougher even than the machine that he will—will endure and will outlast the—the age in which that machine dominates.
I'm sure we're all very grateful to you for coming down and answering our questions this morning.
Thank you sir.
Ladies and Gentleman the Department of English at the University of Virginia is honored to presennd is also very pleased that so many of you were able to travel—so many of you long distances—to be present this afternoonill first read from his short story "Shingles for the Lord" and when that is finished is open to questions and on any direction.Pap got uood hour before daylight and caught the mule and rid down to Killegrews' to borrow the froe and maul.
He ought to been back with it in forty minutes.
But the sun had rose anad done milked and fed and was eating my breakfast when he got back with the mule not only iather but right on the edge of the thumps too.
"Fox hunting" he said.
"Fox huntingeventy-year-old man with both feet and one knee too already in the grave squatting all night oill and calling himself listening tox race that he couldn't even hear unless they had come right up onto the same log he was setting on and bayed into his ear trumpet.
Give me my breakfast" he told maw.
"Whitfield is standing there right this minute straddle of that board tree with his watch in his hand."
And he was.
We rid on past the church and there was not only Solon Quick's school-bus truck but Reverend Whitfield's old mare too.
We tied the mule tapling and hung our dinner bucket oimb and with pap toting Killegrew's froe and maul and the wedges and me toting our ax we went on to the board tree where Solon and Homer Bookwright with their froes and mauls and axes and wedges was setting on two upended cuts and Whitfield was standing jest like pap said in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants and necktie holding his watch in his hand.
It was gold and in the morning sunlight it looked as big aull-growed squash.
"You're late" he said.
So pap told them again about how Old Man Killegrew had been off fox hunting all night and nobody at home to lend him the froe buillegrew and the cook.
And naturally the cook wasn't going to lend none of Killegrew's tools out anillegrew was worser deaf than even Killegrew.
If you was to run in and tell her the house was afire she would jest keep on rocking and say she thought so too  unless she began to holler back to the cook to turn the dogs loose before you could even open your mouth.
"You could have gone yesterday and borrowed the froe" Whitfield said.
"You have known foonth now that you had promised this one day out ohole summer toward puttinoof on the house of God."
"We ain't but two hours late" pap said.
"I reckon the Lord will forgive it.
He ain't interested in time nohow.
He's interested in salvation."
Whitfield never even waited for pap to finish.
It looked to me like he even got taller thundering down at pap likloudburst.
"He ain't interested in neither!
Why should He be when He owns them both?
And why should He turn around for the poor mizzling souls of men that can't even borrow tools in time to replace the shingles on His churcon't know either.
Maybe it's just because He made them.
Maybe He just said to Himself 'I made themon't know why.
But sinciodfrey I'll roll my sleeves up and drag them into glory whether they will or no!'"
But that wasn't here nor there neither now aneckon he knowed it jest like he knowed there wasn't going to be nothing atall here as long as he stayed.
So he put the watch back into his pocket and motioned Solon and Homer up and we all taken off our hats except him while he stood there with his face raised into the sun and his eyes shut and his eyebrows looking big like iron-gray caterpillars lying along the edge oliff.
"Lord" he said "make them good straight shingles to lay smooth and let them split out easy; they're for You" and opened his eyes and looked at us again mostly at pap and went and untied his mare and clumb up slow and stiff like old men do and rid away.
Pap put down the froe and maul and laid the three wedges ieat row on the ground and taken up the ax.
"Well men" he said "let's get started.
We're already late."
"Me and Homer ain't" Solon said.
"We was here."
This time him and Homer didn't set on the cuts.
They squatted on their heels.
Theeen that Homer was whittling otickadn't noticed it before.
"I make it two hours anittle over" Solon said.
"More or less."
Pap was still about half stooped over holding the ax.
"It's nigher one" he said.
"But call it two for the sake of the argument.
What about itWhat argumentomer said.
"All right" pap said.
"Two hours then.
What about itWhich is three man-hour unitour multiplied by two hours" Solon said.
"Ootal of six work units."
When the WPA first come to Yoknapatawpha County and started to giving out jobs and grub and mattresses Solon went in to Jefferson to get on it.
He would drive his school-bus truck the twenty-two miles in to town every morning and come back that night.
He done that for almoseek before he found out he would not only have to sign his farm off into somebody else's name he couldn't even own and run the school bus that he had built himself.
So he come back that night and never went back no more and since then hadn't nobody better mention WP ano him unless they aimed to fight too though every now and then he would turn up with something all figured down into work units like he done now.
"Six units short."
"Four of which you and Homer could have already worked out while you was setting here waiting on me" pap said.
"Except that we didn't" Solon said.
"We promised Whitfield two units of twelve three-unit hours toward getting some new shingles on the church roof.
We been here ever since sunup waiting for the third unit to show up so we could start.
You don't seem to kept up with these modern ideas about work that's been flooding and uplifting the country in the last few years."
"What modren ideasap said.
"I didn't know there was but one idea about work—until it is done it ain't done and when it is done it is."
Homer made another long steady whittle on the stick.
His knife was sharp aazor.
Solon taken out his snuffbox and filled the top and tilted the snuff into his lip and offered the box to Homer and Homer shaken his head and Solon put the top back on the box and put the box back into his pocket.
"So" pap said "jest becausad to wait two hours fold seventy-year man to get back from fox hunting that never had no more business setting out in the woods all night than he would 'a' had setting all night iighway juke joint we all three have got to come back here tomorrow to finish them two hours that vou and Home "I ain't" Solon said.
"I don't know about Homerromised Whitfield one dayas here at sunup to start it.
When the sun goes dowill consideave done finished it."
"I see" pap said.
"I see.
It's me that's got to come back.
By myselfot to break intull morning to make up them two hours that you and Homer spent restingot to spend two hours of the next day making up for the two hours of the day before that you and Homer never even worked."
"It's going to more than jest break intorning" Solon said.
"It's going to wreck it.
There's six units left over.
Six one-man-hour units.
Maybe you can work twice as fast as me and Homer put together and finish them in four hours buon't believe you can work three times as fast and finish in two."
"Maybe there's something else besides cash you might be able to trade with" Solon said.
"You might use that dog."
That was when pap actually stoppedidn't know it myself then either buound ouood long time before Solon did.
Pap set there with the maul up over his head and the blade of the froe set against the block for the next lick looking up at Solon.
"The doge said.
It waind of mixed hound witittle bird dog and some collie and maybonsiderable of almost anything else but it would ease through the woods without no more noise thaant and pick uquirrel's trail on the ground and bark jest once unless it knowed you was where you could see it and then tiptoe that trail out jest likan and never make another sound until it treed and only then when it knowed you hadn't kept in sight of it.
It belonged to pap and Vernon Tull together.
Will Varner give it to Tull auppy and pap raised it foalf interest; me and him trained it and it slept in my bed with me until it got so big maw finally run it out of the house and for the last six months Solon had been trying to buy it.
Him and Tull had agreed on two dollars for Tull's half of it but Solon and pap was still six dollars apart on ourn because pap said it was worth ten dollars of anybody's money and if Tull wasn't going to collect his half of that he was going to collect it for him.
"So that's it" pap said.
"Them things wasn't work units atall.
They was dog units."
"Jesuggestion" Solon said.
"Jesriendly offer to keep them runaway shingles from breaking up your private business for six hours tomorrow morning.
You sell me your half of that trick overgrown fyce and I'll finish these shingles for you."
"Naturally including them six extra units of one dollars" pap said.
"No no" Solon said.
"I'll pay you the same two dollars for your half of that dog that me and Tull agreed on for his half of it.
You meet me here tomorrow morning with the dog and you can go on back home or wherever them urgent private affairs are located and forget about that church roof."
"Your half of the dog for that halay's work you still owe on them shingles."
"And the two dollars" pap said.
"That you and Tull agreed onell you half the dog for two dollars and you come back here tomorrow and finish the shingles.
You give me the two dollars now and I'll meet you here in the morning with the dog and you can show me the receipt from Tull for his half then."
"Me and Tull have already agreed" Solon said.
"All right" pap said.
"Then you can pay Tull his two dollars and bring his receipt with you without no trouble."
"Tull will be at the church tomorrow morning pulling off them old shingles" Solon said.
"All right" pap said.
"Then it won't be no trouble at all for you to geeceipt from him.
You can stop at the church when you pass.
Tull ain't named Grier.
He won't need to be off somewhere tomorrow morning borrowinrowbar."
So Solon taken out his purse and paid pap the two dollars and they went back to work.
And now it looked like they really was trying to finish that afternoon not jest Solon but even Homer that didn't even seem to be concerned in it nohow and pap that had already swappealog to get rid of whatever work Solon claimed would be left overuit trying to stay up with themest stacked shingles.
Then Solon laid his froe and maul down.
"Well men" he said "I don't know what you fellers think buonsider thiay."
"All right" pap said.
"You are the one to decide when to quit since whatever elbow units you consider are going to be shy tomorrow will be yourn."
"That'act" Solon said.
"And sincm givinay analf to the church instead of jesay liktarted out doineckoetter get on home and tend tittle of my own work."
He picked up his froe and maul and ax and went to his truck and stood waiting for Homer to come and get in.
"I'll be here in the morning with the dog" pap said.
"Sholy" Solon said.
It sounded like he had forgot about the dog or that it wasn't no longer any importance.
But he stood there again and looked hard and quiet at pap for abouecond.
"Anill of sale from Tull for his half of it.
As you say it won't be no trouble a-tall to get that from him."
Him and Homer got into the truck and he started the engine.
You couldn't say jest what it was.
It was almost like Solon was hurrying himself so pap wouldn't have to make any excuse or pretense toward doing or not doing anything.
"I have always understood the fact that lightning don't have to hit twice is one of the reasons why they named it lightning.
So getting lightning-struck iistake that might happen to any man.
The mistakeem to made iever realized in time that whaas looking at waloud.
I'll see you in the morning."
"With the dog" pap said.
"Certainly" Solon said again like it had slipped his mind completely.
"With the dog."
Then him and Homer drove off.
Then pap got up.
"What said.
"What?
You swapped him your half of Tull's dog for that halay's work tomorrow.
Now whatYes" pap said.
"Only before thaad already swapped Tulalay's work pulling off them old shingles tomorrow for Tull's half of that dog.
Only we ain't got to wait until tomorrow.
We're going to pull them shingles off tonight and without no more racket about it than is necessaryon't aim to have nothing on my mind tomorrow but watching  Solon Work-Unit Quick trying to geill of sale for two dollars or ten dollars either on the other half of that dog.
And we'll do it tonighton't want him jest to find out at sunup tomorrow that he is too lateant him to find out then that even when he had laid down to sleep he was already too late."
So we went back home aned and milked while pap went down to Killegrews' to carry the froe and maul back and to borrorowbar.
But of all places in the world and doing what under the sun with it Old Man Killegrew had went and lost his crowbar out ooat in forty feet of water.
And pap said how he come withinch of going to Solon's and borrowing his crowbar out of pure poetic justice  only Solon might have smelled the rat jest from the idea of the crowbar.
So pap went to Armstid's and borrowed hisn and come back and we et supper and cleaned and filled the lantern while maw still tried to find out what we was up to that couldn't wait till morning.
We left her still talking even as far as the front gate and come on back to the church walking this time with the rope and crowbar anammer for me and the lantern still dark.
Whitfield and Snopes was unloadinadder from Snopes' wagon when we passed the church on the way home before dark so all we had to do was to set the ladder up against the church.
Then pap clumb up onto the roof with the lantern and pulled off shingles until he could hang the lantern inside behind the decking where it could shine out through the cracks in the planks but you couldn't see it unless you was passing in the road and by that time anybody would 'a' already heard us.
Thelumb up with the rope and pap reached it through the decking and arounafter and back and tied the ends around our waists and we started.
And we went at it.
We had them old shingles jest raining down me using the claw hammer and pap using- the crowbar working the bar undehole patch of shingles at one time and then laying back on the bar like in one more lick or if—or if the crowbar ever happened for one second to geolid holt he would tilt the whole roof up at one time likinged box lid.
That's exactly what he finally done he laid back on the bar and this time he—it goolt.
It wasn't jesatch of shingles it wahole section of decking so that when he lunged back he snatched that whole section of roof from around the lantern like you would shucorn nubbin.
The lantern was hanging oail.
He never even moved the nail he jest pulled the board off of it so that it looked like fohole minutatched the lantern and the crowbar too setting there in the empty air iittle mess of floating shingles  with the empty nail still sticking through the bail of the lantern before the whole thing started down into the church.
It hit the floor and bounced once.
Then it hit the floor again and this time the whole church jest blowed up intit of yellow jumping fire with me and pap hanging over the edge of it on two ropes.on't know what become of the rope nor how we got out of iton't remember climbing down.
Jest pap yelling behind me and pushing me halfway down the ladder and then throwing me the rest of the way bandful of my overhalls and then we was both on the ground running for the water barrel.
It set under the gutter spout at the side and Armstid was there then; he had happened to go out to his lot abouour back and seen the lantern on the church roof and it stayed on his mind until finally he come up to see what was going on and got there jest in time to stand yelling back and forth with pap across the water barrel.
Anelieve we still would have put it out.
Pap turned and squatted against the barrel and goolt of it over his shoulder and stood up with that barrel that was almost full and run around the corner and up the steps of the church and hooked his toe on the top step and come down with the barrel busting on top of him and knocking him cold out aedge.
So we had to drag him back first and maw was there then anrmstid about the same time and me and Armstid run with the two fire buckets to the spring and when we got back there walenty there Whitfield too with more buckets and we done what we could but the spring was two hundred yards away and ten buckets emptied it and it taken five minutes to fill again so finally we all jest stood around where pap had come to again witig cut on his head and watched it go.
It wald church long dried out and full of old colored-picture charts that Whitfield had accumulated for more than fifty years that the lantern had lit right in the middle of when it finally exploded.
There wapecial nail where he would keeld long nightshirt he would wear to baptize insed to watch it all the time during church and Sunday school and me and the other boys would go past the church sometimes jest to peep in at it because toy of ten it wasn't jesloth garment or everon armor; it was the old strong Arch—Archangel Michael his self that had fit and strove and conquered sin for so long that it finally had the same contempt for the human beings that returned always to sin as hogs and dogs done that the old strong archangel himself must have had.
So foong time it never burned even after everything else inside had.
We could watch it hanging there among the fire not like it had knowed in its time too much water to burn easy but like it had strove and fit with the devil and all the hosts of hell too long to burn in jesire like Res Grier started trying to beat Solon Quick out of halog.
But at last it went too not iurry still but jest all at once kind of roaring right up on and out against the stars and the far dark spaces.
And then there wasn't nothing but jest pap drenched and groggy-looking on the ground with the rest of us around him and Whitfield like always in his boiled shirt and his black hat and pants standing there with his hat on too like he had strove too long to save what hadn't ought to been created in the first place from the damnation it didn't even want to escape to bother to need to take his hat off in any presence.
He looked around at us from under it; we was all there now all that belonged to that church and used it to be born and marry and die from—us and the Armstids and Tulls and Bookwrights and Quick and Snopeses.
"I was wrong" Whitfield said.
"I told you we would meet here tomorrow to roohurch.
We'll meet here in the morning to raise one."
"Of course we got to havhurch" pap said.
"We're going to have one.
And we're going to have it soon.
But there's some of us done already givay or so this week at the cost of our own work.
Which is right and just and we're going to give more and glad to.
Buon't believe that the Lor Whitfield let him finish.
He never moved.
He jest stood there until pap finally run down out of his own accord and hushed and set there on the ground mostly not looking at maw before Whitfield opened his mouth.
"Not you" Whitfield said.
"Arsonist."
"Arsonistap said.
"Yes" Whitfield said.
"If there is any pursuit in which you can engage without carrying flood and fire and destruction and death behind you do it.
But not one hand shall you lay to this new house until you have proved to us that you are to be trusted again with the powers and capacities oan."
He looked about at us again.
"Tull and Snopes and Armstid have already promised for tomorrownderstand that Quick had another half day he intende "I can give another day" Solon said.
"I can give the rest of the week" Homer said.
"I ain't rushed neither" Snopes said.
"That will be enough to start with then" Whitfield said.
"It's late now.
Let us all go home."
He went first.
He didn't look back once at the church or at us.
He went to the old mare and clumb up slow and stiff and powerful and was gone and we went too scattering.
Buooked back at it.
It was jeshell now wited and fading core anad hated it at times and feared it at others anhould have been glad.
But there was something that even that fire hadn't even touched.
Maybe that's all it was—jest indestructibility endurability—that old man that could plan to build it back while its walls was still fire-fierce and then calmly turn his back and go away because he knowed that the men that had never had nothing to give toward the new one but their work would be there at sunup tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that too as long as it was needed to give that work to build it back again.
So it hadn't gone a-tall; it didn't no more care for that little fire and flood than Whitfield's old baptizing gown had done.
Then we was home.
Maw had left so fast the lamp was still lit and we could see pap now still leavinuddle where he stood witut across the back of his head where the barrel had busted and the blood-streaked water soaking him to the waist.
"Get them wet clothes off" maw said.
"I don't know aill or not" pap said.
"I been publicly notified thain't fitten to associate with white folks sublicly notify them same white folks and Methodists too not to try to associate with me or the devil can have the hindmost."
But maw hadn't even listened.
When she come back witan of water anowel and the liniment bottle pap was already in his nightshirt.
"I don't want none of that neither" he said.
"If my head wasn't worth busting it ain't worth patching."
But she never paid no mind to that neither.
She washed his head off and dried it and put the bandage on and went out again and pap went and got into bed.
"Hand me my snuff; then you get out of here and stay out too" he said.
But beforould do that maw come back.
She halass of hot toddy and she went to the bed and stood there with it and pap turned his head and looked at it.
"What's thate said.
But maw never answered and then he set up in bed and draweong shuddering breath—we could hear it—and afteinute he put out his hand for the toddy and set there holding it and drawing his breath and then he takeip of it.
"I Godfrey if him and all of them put together think they can keep me from working on my own church like ary other man he better bood man to try it."
He taken another sip of the toddy.
Then he takeong one.
"Arsonist" he said.
"Work units.
Dog units.
And now arsonistodfrey whaay!"
and   Questions are in order now.
Yes sir.
why do you choose to so often have your characters dressed in the vestments of—of the Christian myth making at times Christ-like people like Popeye or Joe Christmas or even Benjy making them at other times Madonna-like such as the woman in Sanctuary and at other times Judas-like such as Lucas Burch in Light in August thinriter has to write out of his—his experience his background.
He also haort of lumber room like the carpenter has a—a lumber roooom full of scraps of boards of this and that and when he finds that he needs something to tell the story he's trying to tell he looks around in the lumber room and he findoard that—that he can use.
And since my past is a—or my background ihristian background my education is the normal education full of the Christian symbolse them as the carpenter uses the boards that fit the job.
I'm not trying to write about symbols at all.
I'm writing about people buse these symbols simply because they're shortcuts to help me tell the story I'm trying to tell.
Yes sir.Sir why do you sometimes satirize the South and at other times very—very strenuously satirize it?
And what is your general feeling of the South and the deep Southt's my country my native land anove it.
I'm not trying to satirize it.
I'm—I'm trying—that is I'm not expressing my own ideas in the storieell.
I'm telling about people and these people express ideas which—which sometimes are mine sometimes are not mine buyself am not trying to satirize my countryove it and it has its faults anill try to correct them buouldn't try to—to correct them when I'm writintory because I'm telling—talking about people then.
Yes sir.When you draw your characters they're probably compositemagine of people that you have met and known but is there any special character or characters you draw on more than others from real lifeo it's—the writer has three sources observation imagination and experience and doubt—I probably—even he can't say at one time just how much of each one he has used.
He is too busy trying to make a—a human being that—that is alive that will stand up and cashadow behind him and he is—the writer is completely amoral and he will take what he needs where he finds it because he is perfectly willing for anyone to take from him what they find in what he has done that they can use.
Yes sir.What would you say would be the relation in this rather charming story you just read to the—what kind of lumber did you take from fact to build this story?
What would you know of and see and hear and how did you shape it to make it different from what you might have known in lifeell these people thanow they are my people anove them.
They might well have—have done thisust got to it before they did.
audience laughteYes ma'am.I want to ask you an entirely different question.
I've brought some students who are creative writing students and I'd like to ask if you have some suggestions—different suggestions that you thineginning writer should havoung writer should have.
The first thing to dhink is to read to read and to read and to read.
Aay the—the—the writer has got to havumber room like the carpenter and the best lumber room he can have is the—the—the good books to read and to read and to read.
The—the next thing is to—to watch people to try to understand why people do what they do whether the—the motives are good motives or base motives to understand to not judge their motives just to understand them and then to workhink if the young writer can—can follow those three rules he can make his own rules that suit his particular case as he goes along but they are good general rulehink fooung writer to follow.
Yes sir.Sir you said he has to read the good books.
What were the good books that you ready the good bookean the books that have—people still reaundred and two and three hundred years afterwards and they would be what we call the classics.
There are good books printed today but I—I meant only books that people have still read enough so that they are still remembered and still known.
It doesn't mean the books themselves are good.
It means that they were good enough that people still like to read them and since they have—have continued to read them for these one hundred or two or three hundred years they'll probably continue for another three or four hundred years.
Yes sir.Sir musriter always be objective or must he get in and actually sort of live what he is writing about?
In other words make iart of the—an integral part of his lifeo be completely objective you'll becomeportersed to think that it took talent to briter but nohink it takes mostly insight.
That means to—to—to wonder to—to speculate always why people do what they do and you've got to get inside people.
You've got to love people at the same time that you hate people to do that.
You can't be on the outside.
Then you're juseporter.
You've got to be in the middle of life to write about it and that's what you're writing about you know is life is motion.
Yes ma'am.Cariter—can he write without ever passing judgment on his characters—well he—I doubt if—if you can know anybody an imaginary character or—or living person without passing judgment on them.
That's—that'ittle too God-like.
You've got to pass judgment.
You've got to love you've got to hate even the character that you have created yourself.
what is your objective in using long sentences over short sentences?
Do you think—is thatream-of-consciousness effect or do you feel you can convey your thoughts easier by themhat iatter of the carpenter trying to find the—the hammer or the axe that he thinks will—will do the best job.
Another thing is—everyone haoreknowledge of death.
That is he will have only a—a very short time comparatively to—to do the work and he is trying to put the whole history of the human heart on the head oin you might say.
Also to me no man is himself.
He is the sum of his past.
There's no such thing really as "was" because the past is.
It iart of—of—of every man every woman at every moment.
All of his and her ancestry background is alart of him—of himself and herself at any moment.
And san a—a character itory at any moment of action is not just himself as he is then.
He is all that made him —1 Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight we bring you gap in tape2 If ever there was no need for introductiouppose it's tonight son't.
One thing before we begin is anyone expecting to heaiscuss ... ... To begihought we'd aso reaart from his new novel that will be published in today's issue of The Saturday Evening Post ... "The Waifs" ... and he will read from that selection.pplausoblet was kind enough to say that the amplifier might disconcert mittle buhink that aold him that—that nobody's here that don't want to be here so there's no reason for me to be disconcerted and ion't speak clearly enough be sure and tell me and I'll try to do better.
I'm not in the—not too accustomed to this sort of thing.
So anytimet slack about speaking please tell me.
Do we take the whole thing or have you blue-pencilled in hereo sir.
... just where it begins where the children come.
And one more thing.
One morning—it was summer again now July—the northbound train from New Orleans stopped and the first man off was usually the Negro porter—not the Pullman porters they were always back down the track at the end; we hardly ever saw them but the one from the day coaches at the front end—to get down and struittle while—while he talked to the section hands and the other Negroes that were always around to meet the passenger trains.
But this time it was the conductor himself almost jumping down before the train stopped with the white flagman at his heels almost stepping on them; the porter himself didn't get off at all he—just his head sticking ouindow about half way down the car.
Then four things got offean they were children.
The tallest wairl though we never did know whether she was the oldest or just the tallest then two boys all three in overalls and theittle one iingle garment down to its heels likan's shirt and made out olour- or meal-sack or maybcrap of an old tent.
Wired to the front of each one of them wahipping tag written in pencil FROM BYRON SNOPES EL PASO TEXAS TO MR. FLEM SNOPES JEFFERSON MISSISSIPPI  Though Snopes wasn't there.
He was busy beinanker now aneacon in the Baptist church living in solitary widowerhood in the old De Spain house which he had remodeled into an ante-bellum Southern mansion; he wasn't there to meet them.
It was Dink Quistenberry.
He had married one of Snopes's sisters or nieces or something out at Frenchman's Bend and when Snopes sent I.O.
Snopes back to the country the Quistenberrys came in to buy or rent or anyway to run the Snopes Hotel which wasn't the Snopes Hotel any more now but the Jefferson Hotel though the people that stayed there were still the stock traders and juries locked up by the Circuit Courtean Dink was old enough to be Snopes's brother-in-law or whatever it was but he was the kind of man it just didn't occur to you to say Mister to.
He was thereeckon Snopes sent him.
And when he saw theeckon he felt just like we did when we saw them and like the conductor and the flagman and the porter all looked like they had been feeling ever since the train left New Orleans which was evidently where they got on it.
Because they didn't look like people.
They looked like snakes.
Or maybe that's too strong too.
Anyway they didn't look like children; if there was one thing in the world they didn't look like it was children with kind of dark pasty faces and black hair that looked like somebody had puowl on top of their heads and then cut their hair up to the rim of the bowl witull knife and perfectly black perfectly still eyes that nobody in Jefferson (Yoknapatawpha County either) ever afterward claimed they saw blink.ont know how Dink talked to them because the conductor had already told everybody listening (there waood crowd by that time) that they didn't talk any language or anything else that he had ever heard of—heard of and that to watch them because one of them hawitch knife witix-inch blade he didn't know which one and he himself wasn't going to try to find out.
But anyway Dink got them into his car and the train went on.
Maybe it was the same thing they used in drugstores or at least with Skeets McGowan in Christian's because it wasn'eek before they could go into Christian's all four of them (it was always all four of them as if when the medicine man or whoever it was separated each succeeding one from the mother he just attached the severed cord to the next senior child.
Because by that time we knew who they were Byron Snopes's children out of a—a Jicarilla Apache squaw in Old Mexico) and come out two minutes later all eating ice-cream cones.
They were always together and anywhere in town or near it at any time of day until we found out it was any time of night too; one night at two oclock in the morning when Otis Harker caught them coming in single file from behind the Coca-Cola bottling plant; Otis said he didn't know how in the world they got into it because no door was open nor window broken but he could smell warm Coca-Cola syrup spilled down the front of the little one's nightshirt or dressing-sacque or whatever it was from five or six feet away.
Because that was as close as he got; he said he hollered at them to go on home to the Snopeseean the Jefferson Hotel but they just stood there looking at him and he said he never intended anything just to get them moving since maybe they didn't understand what he meant yet.
So he sort of flung his arms out and was kind of jumping at them hollering again when he stopped himself just in time the knife already in one of their hands with the blade open at least six inches long; so fast that he never even saw where it came from and in the next minute gone so fast he still didn't even know which one of the three in over-alls—the girl or the two boys—had it; that was when Connors went to Dink Quistenberry the next morning and told him he would have to keep them off the streets at night.
"Sure" Dink said.
"You try it.
You keep them off the streets or off anywhere else.
You got my full permission.
You're welcome to it!"
So when the dog business happened even Hub Hampton himself didn't get any closer to them than that.
This was the dog business.
We were getting paved streets in Jefferson now and so more new families engineers and contractors and such like the little Riddell boys' papa—the little Riddell boys that gave us that holiday two years ago had moved to Jefferson.
One of them didn't—them didn't have any children but they haadillac and his wife haog that they said cost five hundred dollars the only dog higher than fifty dollars excepield-trial pointer or setter (anart Airedale bear dog named Lion that Major de Spain de Spain's father owned once that hunting people in north Mississippi still talked about) that Jefferson ever heard of let alone saw—a Pekinese witold name-plate on its collar that probably didn't even know it waog that rode in the Cadillac and sneered through the windows not just at other dogs but at people too and even ate special meat that Wall Snopes's butcher ordered special from Kansas City because it cost too much for just people to buy and eat.
One day it disappeared.
Nobody knew how since the only time it wasn't sneering out through the Cadillac window it was sneering out througindow in the house where it—they—lived.
But it was gone anont think anywhere else ever saoman take on over anything like  Widrington did with rewards in all the Memphis and north Mississippi and west Tennessee and east Arkansas papers and Hampton and Connors neither able to sleep at night for  Widrington ringing their telephone and the man from the insurance company (its life was insured too so maybe there were more people insured in Jefferson than there were dogs but then there was more of them not insured in Jefferson than there was dogs too)  and  Widrington herself likely at almost any time of day or night to be in your back yard calling what Aleck Sander anhought was Yow!
Yow!
Yow!
until Uncle Gavin told us it was named Lao T'se fohinese poet.
Until one day the four Snopes Indians came out of the Christian's drugstore and somebody passing on the street pointed his finger and hollered "Look!"
It was the collar with the gold name-plate.
The little one was wearing it around its neck above the nightshirt.
Connors—Connors came quick and sent about as quick for Hampton.
And that was when Hampton didn't come any closer either aneckon we was all thinking about what he was whaess that big gut of his would make on the sidewalk if he got too close to that knife before he knew it.
And the four Snopes Indians or Indian Snopeses whichever is right standing iow watching him not looking dangerous not looking anything; not innocent especially at nobody—especially and nobody would have called it affectionate but not dangerous in the same sense that four shut pocket knives dont look threatening.
They look just like four shut pocket knives but they dont look lethal.
Until Hampton said "What do they do when they aint eating ice cream up here or breaking in or out of that bottling plant at two oclock in the morningThey goind of camp or reservation or whatever you might call it iave they dug in the big di—big ditch behind the school house" Connors said.
"Did you look thereampton said.
"Sure" Connors said.
"Nothing there but just some trash and bones and stuff they play with."
"Bonesampton said.
"What bonesJust bones" Connors said.
"Chicken bones spare rib stuff like that they been eatineckon."
So Hampton went and got in his car and Connors went to his that had the red light and the sireen on it anew others got in while there was still room and the two cars went to the school house the rest of us walking because we wanted to see if Hampton with his belly really would try to climb down into that ditch and if he did know how he was going to get out again.
But he did it with Connors showing him where the cave was but letting him go first since he was the sheriff on to where the little pile of bones was behind the fireplace and turned them over with his toe and then rakeew of them to one side.
Because he waunteoods maood one before his belly got too big to go throughicket.
"There's your dog" he said.
Anemember that time five years ago now when we were all at the table and Matt Levitt's cut-out passing in the street and Father says now Uncle Gavin "What's that sounmellxcept that Snopes's brass business at the power-plant was beforas even born Uncle Gavin's office that morning and  Widrington and the insurance man because the dog's life had been insured only against disease or accident or acts of God and the insurance man's contention (I reckon he had been in Jefferson long enough to have talked with Ratliff; any stranger in town for just halay let aloneek would find himself doing that) was that four half-Snopeses and half-Jicarilla Apache Indians were none of them and so Jefferson him—itself was liable and vulnerable to suit.
Sad only heard about Snopes and the missing brass from Uncle Gavin buhought about what Father said that day becausad been there then "What's that sounmellhen Snopes came in removing his hat and saying "Morning" to everybody without saying it to anybody; then to the insurance man "How much on that dogFull pedigree value Snopes.
Five hundred dollars" the insurance man said and Snopes (the insurance man himself got up and turned his chair around to the desk for him) sat down and took oulank check from his pocket and filled in the amount and pushed it across the desk in front of Uncle Gavin and got up and said "Morning" without saying it to anybody and put on his hat and went out.
Except that he didn't stop there.
Because the next day Byron Snopes's Indians were gone.
Ratliff came in and told us.
"Sho" he said.
"Flem sent them out to the Bend.
Neither—neither of their grandmawean I.O.
's wives would have them but finally Dee-wit Binford"—Dewitt Binford had married another of the Snopes girls.
They lived near Varner's store—"taken them in.
Oontract the Snopeses all clubbing together pro rata and paying Dee-wiollaeaeek on them providing of course he can laseek.
Though naturally the first four dollars was in advance what you might caletainer you might say."
It wasean just aboueek.
Ratliff came in again; it was in the morning.
"We jest finished using up Frenchman's Bend at noon yesterday and that jest about cleans up the county.
We down at the dee-po now all tagged and the waybill paid waiting for Number Twenty-three southbound or any other train that will connect more or less or thereabouts for El Paso Texas"—telling about that too "A combination you might say of scientific interest and what's that wordntil Uncle Gavin told him anthropological "anthropological coincidence; them four vanishing Americans coming durn nigh taking one white man with them if Clarence Snopes's maw anew neighbors hadn't got there in time."
He told it how when Dewitt Binford got them home he discovered they wouldn't stay in bed at all dragginuilt off onto the floor and lying iow on it and the next morning he and his wife found the bedstead itself dismantled and leaned against the wall iorner out of the way; and they hadn't hearound during the process.
He—Dewitt—said that's what got on his mind even before he begun to worry about the little one you couldn't hear them; you didn't even know they were in the house or not when they had entered it or left it; for all you knew they might be right there in your bedroom in the dark looking at you.
"So he tried it" Ratliff said.
"He went over to Tull's and borrowed Vernon's flashlight and waited until about midnight and he said he never moved quieter in his life across the hall to the door of the room trying to not even breathe if he could help it; he had done already cut out three sighting notches in the door-frame so that when he laid the flashlight into them by feel it would be aimed straight at where—where the middle two heads would be on the pallet; and held his breath again listening until he was sho there wasn'ound and snapped on the light.
And them four faces and them eight black eyes already laying there wide open looking straight at him.
"And Dee-wit said he would like to have give up then.
But by that time that least un wouldn't give him no rest a-tall.
Only he didn't know what to do because he had done been warned about that knife even if he hadn't never seen it.
Then he remembered them pills that bottle of knock-out opium pills that Doc Peabody had give Miz Dee-wit that time the brooder lamp blowed up and burnt most of her front hair off so he taken eight of them and bought four bottles of sody pop at the store and put two capsules into each bottle and druv the caps back on and hid the bottles jest exactly where he figgered they would have to hunt jest exactly hard enough to find them.
And by dark the four bottles was gone and he waited again to be sho it had had plenty of time to work and taken Vernon's flashlight and went across the hall and got on his hands and knees and crawled across to the pallet—he knowed by practice now exactly where on the pallet that least un slept or anyway lay—and reached out easy and found the hem of that nightshirt with one hand and the flashlight ready to snap on in the other.
"And when he told about it he was downright crying not jest skeer so much as pure and simple unbelief.
'I wasn't doing nothing' he says.
'I wasn't going to hurt it.
All in the worlanted was jest to see which it was—'"  "Which is itncle Gavin said.
"That's what I'm telling you" Ratliff said.
"He never even got to snap on the flashlight.
He jest felt them two quick thin streaks of fire one down either cheek of his face; he said that all that time he was already running backward on his hands and knees toward the door he knowed there wouldn't even be time to turn around let alone get on his feet and run not to mention shutting the door behind him; and when he run back into his and Miz Deewit's room there wasn't—there wouldn't be no time to shut that one neither except he had to banging it shut and hollering for Miz Dee-wit now dragging the bureau against it while Miz Dee-wit lit the lamp and then come and holp him until he hollered at her to shut the windows first; almost crying with them two slashes running from each ear jest missing his eye on one side right down to the corners of his mouth likreat big grin that would bust scab and all if he ever let his face go telling how they would decide that the best thing would be to put out the lamp too and set in the dark until he remembered how they had managed somehow to get inside that locked-up Coca-Cola plant without even touching the patented burglar alarm.
"So they jest shut and locked the windows and left the lamp burning sitting there in that air-tight room on that hot summer night until it come daylight enough for Miz Dee-wit to at least jump and dodge on the way back to the kitchen to start the fire in the stove and cook breakfast.
Though the house was empty then.
Not safe of course jest empty except for themselves while they tried to decide whether to try to get word in to Flem or Hub Hampton to come out and get them or jest pack up themselves without even waiting to wash the breakfast dishes and move over to Tull's.
Anyhow Dee-wit said him and Miz Dee-wit was through and they knowed it four dollareek or no four dollareek; so it was about nine oclock he was on his way to the store to use the telephone to call Jefferson when Miz I.O.
Snopeean the number-two one that got superseded back before she ever hahance to move to town saved him the trouble."
We knew Clarence Snopes ourselves.
He would be in town every Saturday or every other time he could gide in according to Ratliff—a big hulking man now eighteen or nineteen who was alray coloraying tinge already to his tow-colored hairayish pasty look to his flesh which looked as if it would not flow blood froound but insteaallid fluid like thin oatmeal; he was the only Snopes or resident of Frenchman's Bend or Yoknapatawpha County either for that matter who made his Texas cousins welcome.
"You might say he adopted them" Ratliff said.
"Right from that first day.
He even claimed he could talk to them and that he was going to train them to hunt iack; they would be better than any jest pack of dogs because sooner or later dogs always quit and went home while it didn't matter to them where they was.
"So he trained them.
The first way he done it was to seottle of sody pop otump in front of the store wittring running from it to where he would be setting on the gallery until they would maneuver around and finally bushwack up to where one of them could reach for it then he would snatch it off the stump with the string and drag it out of their reach.
Only that never worked but once so then he would have to drink the bottles empty and fill them again with muddy water or some such or another good training method was to gather uew throwed-away candy-bar papers and wrap them up again with mud inside or maybe jest not nothing a-tall because it taken theood while to give up then especially if now and then he haho enough candy bar oho enough bottle of strawberry or orange shuffled into the other ones.
"Anyhow he was always with them hollering at them and waving his arms to go this way or that way when folks was watching like dogs; they even had some kind olay house or cave or something in another ditch about halile up the road.
That's right.
What you think you are laughing at is the notion oig almost growed man like Clarence playing all oudden—that's right.
What you think you are laughing at is the notion oig almost growed man like Clarence playing until all oudden you find out that what you're laughing at is calling anything playing that them four things would be interested in.
"So Dee-wit had jest reached the store when here come Clarence's maw down the road hollering 'Them Indians!
Them Indians!'
jest like thaure and simple case of mother love and mother instinct.
Because likely she didn't know anything yet and even if she had in that state she couldn'old nobody jest standing there in the road in front of the store wringing her hands and hollering Them Indians until the men squatting along the gallery begun to get up and then to run because about that time Dee-wit come up.
Because he knowed what Miz Snopes was trying to say.
Maybe he never had no mother love and mother instinct but then neither did Miz Snopes havast-night's knife-slash down both cheeks.
"'Them Indianse says.
'Fore God men run.
It may already be too late.'
"But it wasn't.
They was in time.
Pretty soon they could hear Clarence bellowing and screaming and then they could line him out and the fastest ones run on ahead and down into the ditch to where Clarence was tied tlackjack sapling with something less thaord of wood stacked around him jest beginning to burn good.
"So they was in time.
Jody telephoned Flem right away and in fact all this woulormally took place yesterday evening except that Clarence's hunting pack never reappeared in sight until this morning when Dee-wit lifted the shade enough to see them waiting on the front gallery for breakfast.
But then his house was barred in time because he hadn't never unbarred it from last night.
And Jody's car was already standing by on emergency alert as they say and it wasn't much trouble to toll them into it since like Clarence said one place was jest like another to them.
"So they're down at the dee-po now.
Would either of you gentlemen like to go down with me and watch what—what they call the end orea if that's what they call what I'm trying to say?
The last and final end of Snopes' out-and-out unvarnished behavior in Jefferson if that's what I'm trying to say."
So Ratliff anent to the station while he told me the rest of it.
It was Miss Emily Habersham; she had done the telephoning herself to the Travellers' Aid in New Orleans to meet the Jefferson train and put them on the one for El Paso and to the El Paso Aid to get them across the border and turn them over to the Mexican police to send them back home to Byron Snopes or the reservation or wherever it was.
Theoticed the package and said "What's thatut he didn't answer.
He just parked the pickup and took the cardboard carton and we went around onto the platform where they were the three in the overalls and what Ratliff called the least un in the nightshirt each witew shipping tag wired to the front of its garment but printed in big block capitals this time like shouting this time FROM FLEM SNOPES JEFFERSON MISS.
TO BYRON SNOPES EL PASO TEXAS  There waonsiderable crowd around them aafe distance when we come up and Ratliff opened the carton; it contained four of everything four oranges and apples and candy bars and bags of peanuts and packages of chewing gum.
"Watch out now" Ratliff said.
"Maybe we better set it on the ground and shove it up wittick or something."
But he didn't mean that.
Anyway he didn't do it.
He just said to me "Come on; you aint quite growed so may—they may not snap at you" and moved near and held out one of the oranges the eight eyes not once looking at it nor at us nor at anything that we could see; until the girl the tallest one said something something quick and brittle that sounded quite strange in the treble ohild; whereupon the first hand came out and took the orange then the next and the next orderly not furtive just quick while Ratliff anealt out the fruit and bars and paper bags the empty hand already extended again the objects vanishing somewhere faster than we could follow except the little one in the nightshirt which apparently had no pockets until the girl herself leaned and relieved the overflow.
Then the train came in and stopped; the day coach vestibule clanged and clashed open the narrow steps hanging downward from the orifice likarrow dropped jaw.
Evidently obviously Miss Habersham had telephonerainmaster ouperintendent (maybice president) somewhere too because the conductor and the porter both got down and the conductor looked rapidly at the four tags and motioned and we—all of us; we represented Jefferson—watched them mount and vanish one by one into that iron impatient maw the girl and the two boys in overalls and Ratliff's least un in ankle-length single garment likan's discarded shirt made out of flour- or meal-sacking or perhaps the remnant of an old tent.
We never did know which it was.
the first question that interests us—interested us was this statement you made that one time in your career you felt that to write iood thing.
Could you tell us about that experienceell that was more or less with humorous intentas—was running a—a launch for New Orleans bootlegger then  down—across Pontchartrain down the Industrial Canal into the Gulf to an island and where we would pick up the—the raw sugar cane alcohol that came up from the Caribbean and bring that back to his kitchen and he would turn it into scotch and gin and bourbon whatever you wantedet Sherwood Anderson who lived in New Orleans at that time aniked him very much just as you meean and you know that you get along with him.
We would meet in the afternoons and sit in parks and he would talk anould listen.
We would meet again in the evening and we'd go to a—a well known very elegant brothel then and the—the madam had literary aspirations and the three of us would sit in  —would sit in the courtyard and she would supply the—the whiskey and we would drink and Anderson would talk and she would talk anould listen.
Then the next morninouldn't see him.
He was in seclusion working.
That would go on day after day the afternoons we would meet in the evenings we'd sit over the whiskey and he would talk anould listen anhought that if that was the life it took to briter that was the life for me.
And srote my first book and wheinished it  Anderson said "I'll makrade with you.
Ion't have to read it I'll tell my publisher to take it."
So he—I said "Done" and he told his publisher to take it.
That's hoot printed the first time.
the publication of Sanctuary ...—some of that story that it began and then you took it up again along that same line is the idea of producing something good came in there ..Yerote the other bookas stilachelor and—and footloose anramp and there were thingould doould bootlegger and I—I flew airplanes barnstorming airplanes stunting and hauling passengers out of cow pasturesaousepainter anad apprentice seaman's papersould go aorecastle hand in freighters things like that.
Theot married and my father died anad to settle down and become respectable.
And shoughould writook that would make money see iould makittle money writing and srote Sanctuary thought of the most horrific notioould invent and wrote it sent it to the publisher.
The publisher said "Good Lord if we print this we'll both be in jail."
This was in '27 '28 when you couldn't—couldn't print what you can nowadays.
Sorgot itrote two more books and they were printed and then one daot the galleys for Sanctuary.
Anead it anidn't need money so badly then and anywaad enough perspective to see that it was a—a base notion basely conceived and executed.
Anrote the publisher that we'd throw it away it was no good.
And he said "We can't do thaave had plates made.
I've got money tied up in it.aid "Well I'll—I'll rewrite it then."
He said "All right I'll pay half the new plates and you pay half the new plates."
Said all right anoob and earned enough money to pay my half of the new plates and rewrote the book anade the best booould out of it so that—that its inception was basely conceived but now I'd done the besould with it and I'm not ashamed of iton't like it but I'm not ashamed of it anymore.
It was the first book that sold any anatatement thaas going to get more—more money than I'd ever seen before and before the money came the publisher went bankrupt which served me exactly rightelt that that was exactly whaeserved that whole thing.
Taught messon.
Yes sir.Siavomparatively easy question the story you just read "The Waifs" was ... tall story—tall stories.
Does it have any other meaning other than just beinall storyo to me it was just funny.
Funny anittle terrible too those waif children with—with absolutely no future.
I—it was funny yes.
As it —yes that's righall story.
But with the tragic implications assuming that—that any—any infant human is of some value should be of some value in any culture Yes sir.I understand that in the last year or so you've—you've done some work cooperating with the State Department.
Yes.... Person-to-Person diplomacelieve it's been referred to trying to have—produce better relations between individuals in this country and different fields in the arts and sciences.
Could you tell uittle bit about that and do you think—how successful it can be and how it has been runt's interesting work and very necessary work.
Our culture in this country is so different from European culture in that there's really no place in it for the artist foan of—of simple ideas or even probably of principles.
Ours iulture of success of—of—of power and strength and the representatives of that culture are not understood by the people in the rest of the world.
We—we seem gauche and—and crude and ill-mannered whicon't think we are.
It's simply because we are alien to the culture of the rest of the world.
And the purpose of this was to—to let the people in the rest of the world see that there were other sorts of American beside successful chairmen of General Motors and—and congressmen and senators.
It is the reason for sending people like Louis Armstrong that—that blow horns and—just for the sheer pleasure of blowing horns and writers and people that are interested in something else besides success interested in things of the human spirit rather than in things on—in—the black ink on the ledger.
It was interesting workyself of course can't see just how much good it does.
The report from it is that it doeot of good but I—I don't—am not aware of it myselfo know that—that the—the foreign peoplave—have visited have—have seemed quite anxious to—to learn things about our country whicould have thought they could have known easily.
Theealized that the usual travelled American is not interested in these things and had no reason to tell them and they were too timid to ask.
But to someone who approaches them in their own cultural terms of believing that things of the spirit are important they have less shyness about asking these questions.
And so in that sense it probably doeot of good to give the foreigneruer picture of what this country actually is.
Yes sir.I wonder if you'd care to elaborate on that sir and indicatew of the questions that they sometimes ask.
They are questions about the—the experiences the young writer might have as though they expect to find that his problems in America would be different from the problems ooung writer or young painter anywhere.
And they are not reallyxplain to them that—that to bood artist of any sort you've got primarily be an individualist and an individualist who is demon driven to where he wants to bood writer oood philosopher oood anything else is going to resist the mass pressure to belong tass.
And so he does that and that is no problem to him.
They expect that—that his greatest problem will be to—to resist the pressure of General Motors.
Which it's not really.
His problem is the same as the problem of the artist anywhere which is to understand why people as individuals not as members of groups do what they as individuals do.
The same— gap in tape  Welhink the first would be to believe in—in me in "I" rather than "we" to be oneself to resist the pressure to relinquish individuality.
That's the first thing and maybe that's all anyone has to do to combat communism.
That ihink that it can be combated must be combated and conquered if it is to be conquered not by people forming mass movements and groups but by individuals.
That if the—the—we who would try to proselytize our fellows into resisting communishink that's all we have to teach them the importance of "me" of "I" of "myself."
That—that the individual is more important than any mass or group he belongs to.
That the individual is always more important than any state that—that he belongs to.
That the state must never be the master of the individual it'ervant of the individual.
That the individual—and to retain that superiority over the state the individual must be independent of the state he mustn't accept gratuity from the state he mustn't let the state buy him by pensions or relief or dole or grant of any sort.
Yes sir.
I'd—I'd just like to find out what the people in the deep South—how they react to your books whether they read them as much say as much as people in the North or people in Europenow that people in Europe think that you are the greatest writer in the United Statesas wondering how the people in the deep South think about you.
Someone has said that—that people in the South don't read books they write them.
In my own little town there arew people that—that read the books.
They read them for different reasons some because they—they like me ariend some because they are convinced that sooner or later they will find the people in the town in the books because they don't believe anybody can invent enough people to write for thirty or forty years that you might invent one but the rest of the time you'll be copying somebody you knew.
And they still think that sooner or later they'll catch me having put somebody that they know intook.
Others read the books iort of outraged bafflement.
Our country is poor country.
Nobody is rich there and few people ever have as much as thirty thousand dollars.
They know they'll never have as much as thirty thousand dollars and if they ever did they would have got it out in the sun doing hard work.
Anoreign government suddenly gives me thirty thousand dollars just for sitting on my backside writing books and they simply cannot get over that  and they will really never forgive me or Sweden for that.
That somehow that was an outrage to all the proprieties.
And they read the book to see why in the world anybody should have given anybody thirty thousand dollars for writing the books like that.Sir along these lines how do you think the position of the artist in the South in the deep South compares with that of the artist in say the North or in Europeelould say that in our culture there's really no place for the artist.
In Europe the old cultures there'efinite place the artist quite often—because he iood artist he suddenly find himselower in politics.
Which never happens in this country because he iood artisood writer oood painter oood philosopher.
He—he becomeower in politics in our culture so far because he's been successful.
It doesn't matter what he's successful in.
That's because we still haven't quite exhausted the natural resources to where we have got to use the best in people.
When we reach the point where we have exhausted natural resources and all we have left will be people then the artishink will find a—a place for himself in the—the fabric of the culture.
So far he hasn't.
Yes sir.Sir in light of the same thing when this point is reached when our natural resources are exhausted and people begin to develop do you think individuality will begin to develop alsoell individuality must have developed or we'll never reach that point.
We will—will have been—be sunk by then we will be conquered.I'm sorridn't state that very clearly.
Do you think that what ... faculty has developed in some people artists who have been successful will have developed oarger scalroader scale believnow what you meanould say that—that we will—we will reacoint where we will say that America was the greatest country in the world but we couldn't keep on affording it that we will have to change and then the natural resource which we will have to fall back on which may be our salvation will be the—the will of the few that have insisted on being individuals against all the pressure.
They will come to the top then.
That—that will to be individual was there.
It—it won't need to develop.
It'll—suddenly it will come to the top where we will need that.
As a—aation we will need that.
Yes sir.Sir you state that in order to be an artist one has to be individualistic and then you said that in order to combat communism one must foster or foster the spirit of individualist—individualism.
Noas wondering if there waontradiction between this.
In the case of the Soviet artists if we can call them artists do they have individualism or if they have—are they communistshe ones that we know about whose work we see are not individualists.
They have—have been compressed repressed into the mass.
I'm convinced that the—the heirs to Dostoyevsky Gogol Tolstoy are still writing the—the good books.
They are hidden in out-houses under floors in Russia because they don't dare let the government find them that some day they will appear and those people are the ones who insist on being individualists even iotalitarian condition like Russiahink that no condition no government can destroy the will amonew to be individuals.
Yes sir.Sir your theory to combat sucolitical and social theory as Communism by being an individual sounds very good but is it possible to achieve today in our society for an individual to do that without isolating himself from our society?
If—if it is possible what means would you ... for becoming an individual ...elill use an analogy.
There are some people writers who believe they have talent they believe in the—the dream of perfection.
They get offers to go to Hollywood where they can makot of money.
They begin to acquire junk swimming pools and imported cars and they can't quit their jobs because they've got to continue to own that swimming pool and the imported car.
There are others with the same dream of perfection the same belief that maybe they can match it that go there and—and they—they resist the money.
They don't own the swimming pool the imported cars.
They will do enough work to—to get what they need of the money without becominlave to it.
And that in that sense it's—as you say it is going to be difficult to go completely against the—the grain of the current oulture.
But you can—can compromise—you—you—without selling your individuality completely to it.
You've got to compromise because it makes things easier....
In social legislation how can you combat something like that such as pensions or social security?
What can an individual do about thatell you—...  Your—you probably can't but you can insist on—on yourself keeping free of it.I would still have to be paying taxes ...—  Sure you'd have to pay taxes but—but then we haven't quite reached the stage where one has got to accept social benefits.
You can—you can do work you can joinion.
Of course you have got to acquiesce to an extent to—tass if you joinion.
But you don't have to accepocial benefit you can still be an individualist and belong tnion and work.
And there probably is somewhere in the country still ways thaan can—can eariving without having to belong tnion.
Yes sir.Siew minutes ago you mentioned that people in your hometown were looking into your books for familiar characters.
Realizing that you've goich legacy as it were of experiences it seems to me that nowadays the modern novelist is writing merely thinly disguised autobiography.
Which do you think is really more valuable in the sense of the artist the disguised autobiography or making it up from whole cloth as it were would say that the writer has three sources imagination observation and experience.
He himself doesn't know how much of which he uses at any given moment because each of the sources themselves are not too important to him that he is writing about people and he uses his material from the three sources as—as—as the carpenter reaches into his—his lumber room and findoard that fits the particular corner he's building.
Of course any writer to begin with is writing his—his own biography because he has—has discovered the world and suddenly discovered that it—the world is—is important enough or moving enough or tragic enough to put down on paper or in music or on canvas.
And at that time all he knows is what has happened to him because he has not developed his capacity to—to perceive to draw conclusions to have an insight into people.
His only insight in it is into himself.
And it's biographical because that's the only gauge he has to measure is what he has experienced himself.
As he gets older and works more the imagination is like any muscle it improves with use.
Imagination develops.
His observation gets shrewder as he gets older as he writes and so that when he reaches his peak his best years when his work is best he himself doesn't know and doesn't have time to bother and doesn't really care how much of what comes from each of these sources.
That then he is writing about people writing about the aspirations the—the troubles the anguishes the—the—the courage and the cowardice the baseness and the splendor of—of man of the human heart.
Yes sir.
do you thinriter writes better when he's young or writes better when he's older ...ell that's something you can't say.
Some write best when they're young write themselves out; some never reach their—their top speed until—till late in life.
That's—you just can't say.
That no man knows when he will reach his— will do his best and very few have the courage to say "I've done my best and now is the time to break the pencil and quit."
Very few can do that.
It'ack of courage but probably morack of judgment.
That the artist is trying to matcream of perfection and he still believes as long as he can breathe that he will do it even though his judgment might tell him that he's failed that his work is—is going downhill.
That's difficult to face.
When you've given—dedicated your life to something like that and then before life is over to find out that you've picked the wrong racket you might say when it's too late.Well do you think you've reached your peak ...o.  Nntend to live to be at leasundred and I'll probably still be writing.
That's my—my thought now.
It may change tomorrow but right now that's my thought.Sir concerning individuality you were discussinoment ago you've often said—been quoted that you'riterary man—I beg your pardon you are noiterary man.
By implication one might think that you'd prefer the author who is so to speak spontaneous and not always steady against one who's read all the literature in his culture and giveteady effort to produce and works on his style.
Is that correct ...ow do you mean prefer the author to spend an evening with him or the work he does?
The work he does ...  Now you—... clear up do you mean by implication that you prefer the man who writes so to speak spontaneously or the man who studies his style reads and learns techniques and works out something totally ... would say first that—the the author is not—is of no importance at all it's what he writes.
It don't matter who wrote it.
If—and—to—if you mean prefer him as an individual theill take the former because the intellectual man anouldn't have anything to talk about.
But the man has—has very little to do with his work in my opinion.
The work is the thing.
It don't matter who wrote it.Well then let's say it's work which type of work do you preferelhink that some people must be intellectual must be interested immersed in—in his craft in literature to write to do the work.
Other people must be immersed in something completely different.
They must iense leaekyll and Hyde existence to do the work.
It's the work that matters.
It's not how he did it.
Yes sir.
do you spend as much time in reading as you do in writingot anymore.
Wheas younead everything.
After the—the first war wheame homidn't feel too goodouldn't get around much anpent—couldn't sleep at night anpent abouear reading probably twenty hourayust read everythinould get my hands on.
Now like most writers as they get older they read less and less.
Noead the books again whicnew and liked wheas twenty one years old.
It's very seldoeaew bookYes sir.Earlier in the eveninelieve you said that you—you differentiate between the European artist and the American artist in that the European artist was accepted aart of society.
It's easier for him to express himself over there whereas here in America because of our current trends the artist is not so easy to recognize as accepted in society.
Is that true is that what you saidell I—I didn't—didn't mean that the European artist has less trouble expressing himselfeant that—that he had more oefinite place of importance in the culture of the old countries.But well ...—in one of your recent lecturesked you whether you thought the artist in the United States is part of the society in which he lives or whether he was an outsider looking in on society—looking out at society.
Now is the American artist part of his society today?
Do you still feel that?
If he—if it is hard to be an individualist in the United States then how can the artist who is obviously individualistic be part oociety that is strictly anti-individualisticecause with few exceptions the artist in—in America is—is something else too.
Like me he'armer or he'awyer like Edgar Masters ooctor like William Carlos Williams.
The exceptions are the people who are literary and nothing else and they have no place in the culture until they are successful and make money at it at—at their own trade.
In—in that sense the man can be an individualist and be a—an artist.
Alsawyer can bawyer can be member of the—of the profession of law or medicine and still be an individualist in his own philosophy of livingeant only that—that in the old countriean that—that attainenown as an artist before he knows it he becomeart of the philosophy of his culture—of his—he halace in his government quite often.
In this country that don't happen.
If he ever turns up witlace in the American government it's because he was alsuccessful famer ouccessful doctor or builder of motor cars.
Not because he wauccessful philosopher or successful artist.In other words it'oint occupation?
He has to havoint occupation in other wordshat's right to be perfectly at home anywhere in the American culture yes he—And if he doesn't havoint occupation then he's no longeart of the fabric of that culture is that correcthat's right he's recognized only by his fellows by his fellow craftsmen.And not by society ...hat's right.
Yeoubt if  Charles E. Wilson for instance knows who Edmund Wilson is ever heard of him.
2 At this poinuggest that we announce the public meeting.
I'm invited and we're all gettineer.
Good.
John Longley Jr. Gentlemeapeech all prepared tonight but I've forgotten what it was.
So I'll just say thaould like to introduce to you an old hand on this campus.
He's been around so long now that he's really become one of uho is going to entertain you now.
...
When he and Uncle Buck ran back to the house from discovering that Tomey's Turl had run again they heard Uncle Buddy cursing and bellowing in the kitchen then the fox and the dogs came out of the kitchen and crossed the hall into the dogs' room and they heard them run through the dogs' room into his and Uncle Buck's room then they saw them cross the hall again into Uncle Buddy's room and heard them run through Uncle Buddy's room into the kitchen again and this time it sounded like the whole kitchen chimney had come down and Uncle Buddy bellowing likteamboat blowing and this time the fox and the dogs and five or six sticks of firewood all came out of the kitchen together with Uncle Buddy in the middle of them hitting at everything in sight with another stick.
It waood race.
When he and Uncle Buck ran into their room to get Uncle Buck's necktie the fox had treed behind the clock on the mantel.
Uncle Buck got the necktie from the drawer and kicked the dogs off and lifted the fox down by the scruff of the neck and shoved it back into the crate under the bed and they went to the kitchen where Uncle Buddy was picking the breakfast up out of the ashes and wiping it off with his apron.
"What in damn's hell do you mean" he said "turning that damn fox out with the dogs all loose in the houseDamn the fox" Uncle Buck said.
"Tomey's Turl has broke out again.
Give me and Cass some breakfast quick.
We might just barely catch him before he gets there."
Because they knew exactly where Tomey's Turl had gone he went there every time he could slip off which was about twicear.
He was heading for Hubert Beauchamp's place just over the edge of the next county that Hubert's sister Miss Sophonsiba (Hubert waachelor too like Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy) was still trying to make people call Warwick after the place in England that she said Hubert was probably the true earl of only he never even had enough pride not to mention energy to take the trouble to establish his just rights.
Tomey's Turl would go there to hang around Hubert's girl Tennie until somebody came and got him.
They couldn't keep him at home by buying Tennie from Hubert because Uncle Buck said he and Uncle Buddy had so many niggers already that they could hardly walk around on their own land for them and they couldn't sell Tomey's Turl to Hubert because Hubert said he not only wouldn't buy Tomey's Turl he wouldn't have that damn white half-McCaslin on his place even aree gift not even if Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy were to pay board and keep for him.
And if somebody didn't go and get Tomey's Turl right away Hubert would fetch him back himself bringing Miss Sophonsiba and they would stay foeek or longer Miss Sophonsiba living in Uncle Buddy's room and Uncle Buddy moved clean out of the house sleeping in one of the cabins in the quarters where the niggers used to live in his great-grandfather's time until his great-grandfather died and Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy moved all the niggers into the big house which his great-grandfather had not had time to finish and not even doing the cooking while they were there and not even coming to the house any more except to sit on the front gallery after supper sitting in the darkness between Hubert and Uncle Buck until aftehile even Hubert would give up telling how many more head of niggers and acres of land he would add to what he would give Miss Sophonsiba when she married and go to bed.
And one midnight last summer Uncle Buddy just happened by accident to wake and hear Hubert drive out of the lot and by the time he waked them and they got Miss Sophonsiba up and dressed and the team put to the wagon and caught Hubert it was almost daylight.
So it was always he and Uncle Buck who went to fetch Tomey's Turl because Uncle Buddy never went anywhere not even to town and not even to fetch Tomey's Turl from Hubert's even though they all knew that Uncle Buddy would have risked it ten times as much as Uncle Bud—Buck—Buck could have dared.
Now did you want us to go to—is that enough there or did you want us to go to the fox—to the poker game—?
John Longley Jr. Yeshink reading about the poker prowess.
And—let me see ian find this one now.
...  Not too long yes.
John Longley Jr. Oh yes you can read it ...
If your voice doesn't give out.
Let's see.
You might explain it they're simply been—trying to catch Tomey's Turl.
Then you might begin about here where they are going back into the bedroom again.
...
They ate breakfast fast.
Uncle Buck put on his necktie while they were running toward the lot to catch the horses.
The only time he wore the necktie was on Tomey's Turl's account and he hadn't even had it out of the drawer since that night last summer when Uncle Buddy had waked them in the dark and said "Get up and out of that bed and damn quick."
Uncle Buddy didn't owecktie at all; Uncle Buck said Uncle Buddy wouldn't take the chance even iection like theirs where ladies were so damn seldom thank God thaan could ride for days itraight line without having to dodgingle one.
His grandmother (she was Uncle Buck's and Uncle Buddy's sister; she had raised him following his mother's death.
That was where he had got his christian name McCaslin Carothers McCaslin Edmonds) said that Uncle Buck and Uncle Buddy both used the necktie just as another way of daring people to say they looked like twins because even at sixty they would still fight anyone who claimed he could tell—could not tell them apart; whereupon his father had answered that any man who ever played poker once with Uncle Buddy would never misjudge him again for Uncle Buck or anybody else.
Jonas had the two horses saddled and waiting.
Uncle Buck didn't mounorse like he was any sixty years old either lean and active aat with his round close-cropped white head and his hard little gray eyes and his white-stubbled jaw his foot in the iron and the horse already moving already running at the open gate when Uncle Buck came into the seat.
He scrabbled up too onto the shorter pony before Jonas could boost him up clapping the pony with his heels into its own stiff short-coupled canter out the gate after Uncle Buck when Uncle Buddy (he hadn't even noticed him) stepped out from the gate and caught the bit.
"Watch him" Uncle Buddy said.
"Watch Theophilus.
The minute anything begins to look wrong you ride to hell back here and get me.
You hearYes sir" he said.
"Lemme go nowont even ketch Uncle Buck let alone Tomey's Turl—"  Uncle Buck was riding Black John because if they could just catch sight of Tomey's Turl at least one mile from Hubert's gate Black John would ride him down in two minutes.
So when they came out on the long flat about three miles from Hubert's sure enough there was Tomey's Turl on the Jake mule abouile ahead.
Uncle Buck flung his arm out and back reining in crouched on the big horse his little round head and his gnarled neck thrust forward likooter's.
"Stole away!"
he whispered.
"You stay back where he wont see you and flush.
I'll circle him through the woods and we will bay him at the creek ford."
He waited until Uncle Buck had vanished into the woods.
Then he went on.
But Tomey's Turl saw him.
He was closed—he closed in too fast; maybe he was afraid he wouldn't be there in time to see him when he treed.
It was the best race he had ever seen.
He had never seen old Jake go that fast and nobody had ever known Tomey's Turl to go faster than his natural walk even ridinule.
Uncle Buck whooped once from the woods running on sight then Black John came out of the trees driving soupled out flat and level aawk with Uncle Buck right up—up behind his ears now and yelling so they looked exactly likig black hawk witparrow riding it across the field and over the ditch and across the next field and he was running too; the mare went out before he even knew she was ready he was yelling too.
Because beinigger Tomey's Turl should have jumped down and run for it afoot as soon as he seen them.
But he didn't; maybe Tomey's Turl had been running off from Uncle Buck for so long that he had even got used to running away likhite man would do it.
And it was like he and old Jake had added Tomey's Turl's natural walking speed to the best that old Jake had ever done in his life and it was just exactly enough to beat Uncle Buck to the ford.
Because when he and the pony arrived Uncle—Black John was blown and lathered and Uncle Buck was down leading him around iircle slow—to slow him down and they could already hear Hubert's dinner horile away.
Only fohile Tomey's Turl didn't seem to be at Hubert's either.
The boy was still sitting on the gatepost blowing the horn—there was no gate there; just two posts anigger boy about his size sitting on one of them blowinox-horn; this was what Miss Sophonsiba was still reminding people was named Warwick even when they had already known foong time that's what she aimed to have it called until they wouldn't call it Warwick she wouldn't even seem to know what they were talking about and it would sound as if she and Hubert owned two separate plantations covering the same area of ground one on top of the other.
Hubert was sitting in the spring-house with his boots off and his feet in the water drinkinoddy.
But nobody there had seen Tomey's Turl; foime it looked like Hubert couldn't even place who Uncle Buck was talking about.
"Oh that nigger" he said at last.
"We'll find him after dinner."
Only it didn't seem as if they were going to eat either.
Hubert and Uncle Buck haoddy then Hubert finally sent to tell the boy on the gate post he could quit blowing and he and Uncle Buck and—had another toddy and Uncle Buck still saying "I just want my nigger.
Then we got to get on back home."
"After dinner" Hubert said.
"If we dont start him somewhere around the kitchen we'll put the dogs on him.
They'll find him if it's in the power of mortal Walker dogs to do it."
But at lasand began wavinandkerchief or something white through the broken place in an upstairs shutter.
They went to the house crossing the back gallery Hubert warning them again as he always did to watch out for the rotted floor-board he hadn't got around to having fixed yet.
Then they stood in the hall until presently there waangling and swishing noise and they began to smell the perfume and Miss Sophonsiba came down the stairs.
Her hair was roached undeace cap; she had on her Sunday dress and beads aned ribbon around her throat anittle nigger girl carrying her fan and he stood quietlittle behind Uncle Buck watching her lips until they opened and he could see the roan tooth.
He had never known anyone before witoan tooth and he remembered how one time his grandmother and his father were talking about Uncle Buddy and Uncle Buck and his grandmother said that Miss Sophonsiba had matured intine-looking woman once.
Maybe she had.
He didn't know.
He wasn't but nine.
"Why Mister Theophilus" she said.
"And McCaslin" she said.
She had never looked at him and she wasn't talking to him and he knew it although he was prepared to—to balanced to drag his foot when Uncle Buck did.
"Welcome to Warwick."
He and Uncle Buck dragged their foot.
"I just come to get my nigger" Uncle Buck said.
"Then we got to get on back home."
Then Miss Sophonsiba said something abouumblebee but he couldn't remember that.
It was too fast and there was too much of it the earrings and beads clashing and jingling like little trace chains ooy mule trotting and the perfume stronger too like the earrings and the beads sprayed it out each time they moved and he watched the roan-colored tooth flick and glint between her lips; something about Uncle Buck waee sipping from flower to flower and not staying long anywhere and all that stored sweetness to be wasted on Uncle Buddy's desert air calling Uncle Buddy Mister Amodeus like she called Uncle Buck Mister Theophilus or maybe the honey was being stored up against the advent oueen and who was the lucky queen and when?
"Ma'amncle Buck said.
Then Hubert said "Hahuck beeeckon that nigger's going to think he'uck hornet once he lays hands on him.
Bueckon what Buck's thinking about sipping right now is some meat gravy and biscuit anup of coffee.
And so am I."
They went into the dining room and ate and Miss Sophonsiba said how seriously now neighbors jusalf day's ride apart ought not to be so long as Uncle Buck did and Uncle Buck said Yessum and Miss Sophonsiba said Uncle Buck was jusonfirmed roving bachelor from the cradle born and this time Uncle Buck even quit chewing and looked at her and said Yes ma'am he sure was  and born too late at it to ever change now but at least he could thank God no lady would ever have to suffer the misery of living with him and Uncle Buddy and Miss Sophonsiba said ah then maybe Uncle Buck just aint met the woman yet who would not only accept what Uncle Buck was pleased to call misery but who would make Uncle Buck consider even his freedomall price to pay and Uncle Buck said "Nome.
Not yet."
Then he and  Hubert and Uncle Buck went out on the front gallery and sat down.
Hubert hadn't even got done taking his shoes off again and inviting Uncle Buck to take his off when Miss Sophonsiba came out of the door carryinray with another toddy on it.
"Damnit Sibbey" Hubert said.
"He's just et.
He dont want to drink now."
Miss—but Miss Sophonsiba didn't seem to hear him at all.
She stood there the roan tooth not flicking now but fixed because she wasn't talking now handing the toddy to Uncle Buck until aftehile she said how her papa always said nothing sweeteneissippi toddy like the hand oissippi lady and would Uncle Buck like to see how she use to sweeten her papa's toddy for him?
So she lifted the toddy and tooip of it and handed it again to Uncle Buck and this time Uncle Buck took it.
He dragged his foot again and drank the toddy and said if Hubert was going to lay down he would lay dowhile too since from the way things looked Tomey's Turl was fixing to give theong hard race unless Hubert's dogs weronsiderable better than they used to be.
Hubert and Uncle Buck went into the house.
Aftehile he got up too and went around to the back yard to wait for them.
The first thing he saw was Tomey's Turl's head slipping along behind the lane fence.
But when he cut across the yard to turn him Tomey's Turl wasn't even running.
He was squatting behinush watching the house peering around the bush at the back door and the upstairs windows not whispering exactly but not talking loud either "Whut they doing nowThey're takinap now" he said.
"But never mind that; they're going to put the dogs on you when they get up."
"Hah" Tomey's Turl said.
"And nemmind—nem you mind that neitherot protection now.
Aleeds to do is to keep Old Buck from ketching me untets the word."
"What worde said.
"Word from who?
Is Hubert going to buy you from Uncle BuckHuh" Tomey's Turl said again.
"I got more protection than whut Hubert got even."
He rose to his feet.
"I gonter tell you something to remember anytime you wants to git something done from hoeing ourop to getting married just get the womenfolks to working at it.
Then all you needs to do is set down and wait.
You member that."
Then Tomey's Turl was gone.
And aftehile he went back to the house.
But there wasn't anything but the snoring coming out of the room where Uncle Buck and Hubert were and some more light-sounding snoring coming from upstairs.
He went to the spring-house and sat with his feet in the water as Hubert had been doing because now soon it would be cool enough foace.
And sure enough aftehile Hubert and Uncle Buck came out onto the back gallery with Miss Sophonsiba right behind them with the toddy tray only this time Uncle Buck drank his before Miss Sophonsiba had time to sweeten it  and Miss Sophonsiba told them to get back early that all Uncle Buck knew of Warwick was just dogs and niggers and now that she had him she wanted to show him her garden that Hubert and nobody else had any sayso in.
"Yessum" Uncle Buck said.
"I just want to catch my nigger.
Then we got to get on back home."
Four or five niggers brought up the three horses.
They could already hear the dogs waiting still coupled in the lane and they mounted and went on down the lane toward the quarters with Uncle Buck already out in front of even the dogs.
So he never did know just when and where they jumped Tomey's Turl whether he flushed out of one of the cabins or not.
Uncle Buck was away out in front on Black John and they hadn't even cast the dogs yet when Uncle Buck roared "Gone awayodfrey he broke cover then!"
and Black John's feet clapped four times like pistol shots while he was gathering to go out then he and Uncle Buck vanished over the hill like they had been—like they had run at the blank edge of the world itself.
Hubert was roaring too "Gone away!
Cast them!"
and they all piled over the crest of the hill just in time to see Tomey's Turl away out across the flat almost to the woods and the dogs streaking down the hill and out onto the flat.
They just tongued once and when they came boiling up around Tomey's Turl it looked like they were trying to jump up and lick him in the face until even Tomey's Turl slowed down and he and the dogs all went into the woods together walking like they were going home froabbit hunt.
And when they caught up with Uncle Buck in the woods there was no Tomey's Turl and no dogs either just nothing but old Jake aboualf an hour later hitched intlump of bushes with Tomey's Turl's coat tied on him foaddle and near halushel of Hubert's oats scattered around on the ground that old Jake never even had enough appetite left to nuzzle up and spit back out again.
It wasn't any race at all.
"We'll get him tonight though" Hubert said.
"We'll bait for him.
We'll throicquet of niggers and dogs around Tennie's house about midnight and we'll get him."
"Tonight hell" Uncle Buck said.
"Me and Cass and that nigger all three are going to be half way home by dark.
Aint one of your niggers goyce or something that will trail them houndsAnd fool around here in the woods for half the night tooubert said.
"When I'll bet you five hundred dollars that all you've got to do to catch that nigger is to walk up to Tennie's cabin after dark and call himFive hundred dollarsncle Buck said.
"Done!
Because me and him neither one aint going to be anywhere near Tennie's house by dark.
Five hundred dollars!"
He and Hubert glared at each other.
"Done!"
Hubert said.
So they waited while Hubert sent one of the niggers back to the house on old Jake and in aboualf an hour the nigger came back witittle bob-tailed black fyce anew bottle of whisky.
Then he rode up to Uncle Buck and held something out to him wrapped iiece of paper.
"Whatncle Buck said.
"It's for you" the nigger said.
Then Uncle Buck took it and unwrapped it.
It waiece of red ribbon that had been on Miss Sophonsiba's neck and Uncle Buck sat there on Black John holding the ribbon like it waittle water moccasin only he wasn't going to let anybody see he was afraid of it batting his eyes fast at the nigger.
Then he stopped batting his eyes.
"What fore said.
"She just sont hit to you" the nigger said.
"She say to tell you 'success'."
"She said whatncle Buck said.
"I dont know sir" the nigger said.
"She just say success."
"Oh" Uncle Buck said.
And the fyce found the hounds They heard them first froonsiderable distance.
It was just before sundown and they were not trailing—they were not they were making the noise dogs make when they want to get out of something.
They found out what that was too.
It waen-foot-square cotton-house iield about two miles from Hubert's house and all eleven of the dogs were inside it and the door wedged withunk of wood.
They watched the dogs come boiling out when the nigger opened the door Hubert sitting his horse and looking at the back of Uncle Buck's neck.
"Well well" Hubert said.
"That's something anyway.
You can use them again now.
They dont seem to have no trouble—no more trouble with your nigger than he seems to have with them."
"Not enough" Uncle Buck said.
"That means both of them.
I'll stick to the fyce."
"All right" Hubert said.
Then he said "Hell 'Filus come on.
Let's go eat supperell you all you got to do to catch that nigger is—" "Five hundred dollars" Uncle Buck said.
"Whatubert said.
He and Uncle Buck looked at each other.
They were not glaring now.
They were not joking each other either now.
They sat there in the beginning of twilight looking at each other just blinkinittle.
"What five hundred dollarsubert said.
"That you wont catch that nigger in Tennie's cabin at midnight tonightThat me or that nigger neither aint going to be near nobody's house but mine at midnight tonight."
Now they did glare at each other.
"Five hundred dollars" Hubert said.
"Done."
"Done" Uncle Buck said.
"Done" Hubert said.
"Done" Uncle Buck said.
So Hubert took the dogs and some of the niggers and went back to the house.
Then he and Uncle Buck and the nigger with the fyce went on the nigger leading old Jake with one hand and holding the fyce's leash (it waiece of gnawed plowline) with the other.
Now Uncle Buck let the fyce smell Tomey's Turl's coat; it was like for the first time now the fyce found out what they were after and they would have let him off the leash and kept up with him on the horses only about that time the nigger boy began blowing the fox-horn for supper at the house and they didn't dare risk it.
Then it was full dark.
And then—he didn't know how much later nor where they were how far from the house except that it waood piece and it had been dark for good while and they were still going on with Uncle Buck leaning down—leaning down from time to time to let the fyce have another smell of Tomey's Turl's coat while Uncle Buck took another drink from the whisky bottle—they found that Tomey's Turl had doubled and was makinong swing back toward the house.
"I godfrey we've got him" Uncle Buck said.
"He's going to earth.
We'll cut back to the house and head him before he can den."
So they left the nigger to cast the fyce and followed him on old Jake and he and Uncle Buck rode on to Hubert's stopping on the hills to blow the horses and listen to the fyce down in the creek bottom where Tomey's Turl was still making his swing.
But they never caught him.
They reached the dark quarters; they could see lights still burning in Hubert's house and somebody was blowing the fox-horn again and it wasn't any boy and he had never hearox-horn sound mad before and he and Uncle Buck scattered out on the slope below Tennie's cabin.
Then they heard the fyce not trailing now but yapping abouile away then the nigger whooped and they held the fyce—and they knew the fyce had faulted.
It was at the creek.
They hunted the banks both ways for more than an hour but they couldn't straighten Tomey's Turl out.
At last even Uncle Buck gave up and they started back toward the house the fyce riding too now in front of the nigger on the mule.
They were just coming up the lane to the quarters; they could see on—on along the ridge to where Hubert's house was all dark now when all oudden the fyce gavelp and jumped down from old Jake and hit the ground running and yelling every jump and Uncle Buck was down too and had snatched him off the pony almost before he could clear his feet from the irons and they ran too on past the dark cabins toward the one where the fyce had treed.
"We got him!"
Uncle Buck said.
"Run around to the back.
Dont holler; just grab utick and knock on the back door loud."
Afterward Uncle Buck admitted that it was his own mistake that he had forgotten when eveittle child should have known not ever to stand right in front of or right behinigger when you scare him; but always to stand to one side of him.
Uncle Buck forgot that.
He was standing facing the front door and right in front of it with the fyce right in front of him yelling fire and murder every time it could draew breath; he said the first he knew was when the fyce gavhriek and whirled and Tomey's Turl was right behind it.
Uncle Buck said he never saw the door open; that the fyce just screamed once and ran between his legs and then Tomey's Turl ran right clean over him.
He never even bobbled; he knocked Uncle Buck down and then caught him up before he fell without even stopping snatched him up under one arm still running and carrying him along for about ten feet saying "Look out of here old Buck.
Look out of here old Buck" before he threw him away and went on.
By that time they couldn't even hear the fyce any more at all.
Uncle Buck wasn't hurt; it was only the wind knocked out of him where Tomey's Turl had thrown him down on his back.
But he had been carrying the whisky bottle in his back pocket saving the last drink until Tomey's Turl was captured and he refused to move until he knew for certain it was just whisky and not blood.
So Uncle Buck laid over on his side easy and he knelt behind him and raked the broken glass out of his pocket.
Then they went on to the house.
They walked.
The nigger came up with the horses but nobody said anything to Uncle Buck about riding again.
They couldn't hear the fyce at all now.
"He was going fast all right" Uncle Buck said "Buont believe that even he will catch that fycodfrey whaight."
"We'll catch him tomorrow" he said.
"Tomorrow hell" Uncle Buck said.
"We'll be at home tomorrow.
And the first time Hubert Beauchamp or that nigger either one ever sets foot on my land I'm going to have them arrested for trespass and vagrancy."
The house was dark.
They could hear Hubert snoring good now as if he had settled down to road-gaiting at it.
But they couldn't hear anything from upstairs even when they were inside the dark hall at the foot of the stairs.
"Likely her room will be at the back" Uncle Buck said.
"Where she can holler down to the kitchen without having to get up.
Besides an unmarried lady will sholy have her door locked with strangers in the house."
So Uncle Buck eased himself down onto the bottom step and he knelt and drew Uncle Buck's boots off.
Then he removed his own and set them against the wall and he and Uncle Buck mounted the stairs feeling their way up and into the upper hall.
It was dark too and still there was no sound anywhere except Hubert snoring below so they felt their way along the hall toward the front of the house until they feloor.
They could hear nothing beyond the door and when Uncle Buck tried the knob it opened.
"All right" Uncle Buck whispered.
"Be quiet."
They could seittle now enough to see the shape of the bed and the mosquito-bar.
Uncle Buck threw down his suspenders and unbuttoned his trousers and went to the bed and eased himself carefully down onto the edge of it and he knelt again and drew Uncle Buck's trousers off and he was just removing his own when Uncle Buck lifted the mosquito-bar and raised his feet and rolled into the bed.
That was when Miss Sophonsiba sat up on the other side of Uncle Buck and gave the first scream.
When he reached home just before dinner time the next day he was just about worn out.
He was too tired to eat even if Uncle Buddy had waited to eat dinner first; he couldn't have stayed on the pony another mile without going to sleep.
In fact he must have gone to sleep while he was telling Uncle Buddy because the next thing he knew it was late afternoon and he was lying on some hay in the jolting wagon-bed with Uncle Buddy sitting on the seat above him exactly the same way he saorse or sat in his rocking chair before the kitchen hearth while he was cooking holding the whip exactly as he held the spork or foon he stirred and tasted with.
Uncle Buddy had some cold bread and meat anug of buttermilk wrapped in a—in damp towsacks waiting when he waked up.
He ate sitting in the wagon in almost the last of the afternoon.
They must have come fast because they were not more than two miles from Hubert's.
Uncle Buddy waited for him to eat.
Then he said "Tell me again" and he told it again how he and Uncle Buck finally founoom without anybody in it and Uncle Buck sitting on the side of the bed saying "O godfrey Cassodfrey Cass" and then they heard Hubert's feet on the stairs and watched the light come down the hall and Hubert came in in his nightshirt and walked over and set the candle on the table and stood looking at Uncle Buck.
"Well 'Filus" he said.
"She's got you at last."
"It was an accident" Uncle Buck said.
"I swear to godfrey—" "Hah" Hubert said.
"Dont tell me.
Tell her that."
"I did" Uncle Buck said.
"I did tell herwear to godfrey—" "Sholy" Hubert said.
"And just listen."
They listeneinute.
He had been hearing her all the time.
She was nowhere near as loud as at first; she was just steady.
"Dont you want to go back in there and tell her again it was an accident that you never meant nothing and to just excuse you and forget about it?
All right."
"All right whatncle Buck said.
"Go back in there and tell her again" Hubert said.
Uncle Buck looked at Hubert foinute.
He batted his eyes fast.
"Then what wilome back and tell youe said.
"To meubert said.
"I would call thaorse of another color.
Wouldn't youUncle Buck looked at Hubert.
He batted his eyes fast again.
Then he stopped again.
"Wait" he said.
"Be reasonable.
Said walk intady's bedroom even Miss Sophonsiba's; say just for the sake of the argument there wasn't no other lady in the world but her and salked into hers and tried to get in bed with her would I—woulave tooine-year-old boy with meudience laughter"Reasonable is just what I'm being" Hubert said.
"You come into bear-country of your own free will and accord.
All right; you werrown man and you knew it was bear-country and you knew the way back out like you knew the way in and you had your chance to take it.
But no.
You had to crawl into the den and lay down by the bear.
And whether you did or didn't know the bear was in it dont make any difference.
So if you got back out of that den without evelaw-mark on yoould not only be unreasonable I'd bamned fool.
After all I'd likittle peace and quiet and freedom myself noohance for it.
Yes sir.
She's got you 'Filus and you know it.
You ruard race and you ruood one but you skun the hen-house one time too many."
"Yes" Uncle Buck said.
He drew his breath in and let it out again slow and not loud.
But you could hear it.
"Well" he said.
"Seckon I'll have to take the chance then."
"You already took it" Hubert said.
"You did that when you came back here."
Then he stopped too.
Then he batted his eyes but only about six times.
Then he stopped and looked at Uncle Buck for more thainute.
"What chancee said.
"That five hundred dollars" Uncle Buck said.
"What five hundred dollarsubert said.
He and Uncle Buck looked at each other.
Now it was Hubert that batted his eyes again and then stopped—  "I'll buy the damn girl then and we'll call the rest of this foolishness off."
"Hah" Hubert said again.
"This is the most serious foolishness you ever took part in in your life.
No you said you wanted your chance and now you've got it.
Here it is right here on the table waiting on you."
So Uncle Buck shuffled the cards and Hubert cut them.
Then he took up the deck and dealt in turn until Uncle Buck and Hubert had five.
And Uncle Buck looked at his hanong time and then said two cards and he gave them to him and Hubert looked at his hand quick and said one card and he gave it to him and Hubert flipped his discard onto the two which Uncle Buck had discarded and slid the new card into his hand and opened it out and looked at it quick again and closed it and looked at Uncle Buck and said "Well?
Did you help them threesNo" Uncle Buck said.
"Welid" Hubert said.
He shot his hand across the table so the cards fell face-up in front of Uncle Buck and they were three kings and two fives and said "By God Buck McCaslin you have met your match at last."
"And that was allncle Buddy said.
It was late then near sunset; they would be at Hubert's in another fifteen minutes.
"Yes sir" he said telling that too how Uncle Buck waked him at daylight and he climbed ouindow and got the pony and left and how Uncle Buck said that if they pushed him too close in the meantime he would climb down the gutter too and hide in the woods until Uncle Buddy arrived.
"Hah" Uncle—Uncle Buddy said.
"Was Tomey's Turl thereYes sir" he said.
"He was waiting in the stable wheot the pony.
He said 'Aint they settled it yet? '"
"And what did you sayncle Buddy said.
"I said 'Uncle Buck looks like he's settled.
But Uncle Buddy aint got here yet.'"
"Hah" Uncle Buck—Uncle Buddy said.
And that was about all.
They reached the house.
Maybe Uncle Buck was watching them but if he was he never showed himself never came out of the woods.
So Miss Sophonsiba was nowhere in sight either so at least Uncle Buck didn't give—hadn't quite given up; at least he hadn't asked her yet.
And he and Uncle Buddy and Hubert ate supper and they came in from the kitchen and cleared the table leaving only the lamp on it and the deck of cards.
Then it was just like last night except that Uncle Buddy had no necktie and Hubert wore the clothes now instead oightshirt and it wahaded lamp on the table instead oandle and Hubert sitting at his end of the table with the deck in his hands riffling the edges with his thumb and looking at Uncle Buddy.
Then he tapped the edges even and set the deck out in the middle of the table under the lamp and folded his arms on the edge of the table and leaned forwarittle on the table looking at Uncle Buddy who was sitting at his end of the table with his hands in his lap all one gray color like an old gray rock otump with gray moss on it that still with his round white head like Uncle Buck's but he didn't blink like Uncle Buck and he waittle thicker than Uncle Buck as if from sitting down so much watching food cook as if the things he cooked had made hiittle thicker than he would have been and the things he cooked with and the flour and such had made him all one same quiet color.
"Little toddy before we startubert said.
"I dont drink" Uncle Buddy said.
"That's right" Hubert said.
"I knew there was some thing else besides just being woman-weak that makes 'Filus seem human.
But no matter."
He batted his eyes twice at Uncle Buddy.
"Buck McCaslin against the land and niggers you have heard me promise as Sophonsiba's dowry on the day she marries.
Ieat you 'Filus marries Sibbey without any dowry.
If you beat me you get 'Filus.
Butill get the three hundred dollars 'Filus owes me for Tennie.
Is that correctThat's correct" Uncle Buddy said.
"Stud" Hubert said.
"One hand.
You to shuffle me to cut this boy to deal."
"No" Uncle Buddy said.
"Not Cass.
He's too youngont want him mixed up in any gambling."
"Hah" Hubert said.
"It's said thaan playing cards with Amodeus McCaslin aint gambling.
But no matter."
He was still looking at Uncle Buddy; he never even turned his head when he spoke "Go to the back door and holler.
Bring the first creature that answers animal mule or human that can deal ten cards."
So he went to the back door.
But he didn't even need to call because Tomey's Turl was squatting against the wall just outside the door and they returned to the drawing-room where Hubert still sat with his arms folded on his side of the table and Uncle Buddy sat with his hands in his lap on his side and the deck of cards face-down under the lamp between them.
Neither of them even looked up when he and Tomey's Turl entered.
"Shuffle" Hubert said.
Uncle Buddy shuffled and set the cards back under the lamp and put his hands back in his lap and Hubert cut the deck and folded his arms back onto the table-edge.
"Deal" he said.
Still neither he nor Uncle Buddy looked up.
They just sat there while—while Tomey's Turl's saddle-colored hands came into the light and took up the deck and dealt one card face-down to Hubert and one face-down to Uncle Buddy and one face-up to Hubert and it waing and one face-up to Uncle Buddy and it waix.
"Buck McCaslin against Sibbey's dowry" Hubert said.
"Deal."
And the hand dealt Huberard and it wahree and Uncle Buddard and it wawo.
Hubert looked at Uncle Buddy.
Uncle Buddy rapped once with his knuckles on the table.
"Deal" Hubert said.
And the hand dealt Huberard and it was another three and Uncle Buddard and it waour.
Hubert looked at Uncle Buddy's cards.
Then he looked at Uncle Buddy and Uncle Buddy rapped on the table again with his knuckles.
"Deal" Hubert said and the hand dealt him an ace and Uncle Buddive and now Hubert just sat still.
He didn't look at anything or move fohole minute; he just sat there and watched Uncle Buddy put one hand onto the table for the first time since he shuffled and pinch up one corner of his face-down card and look at it and and then put his hand back into his lap.
"Check" Hubert said.
"I'll bet you them two niggers" Uncle Buck—Buddy said.
He didn't move either.
He just sat just like he sat in the wagon or oorse or in the rocking chair he cooked from.
"Against whatubert said.
"Against the three hundred dollars Theophilus owes you for Tennie and the three hundred you and Theophilus agreed on for Tomey's Turl" Uncle Buddy said.
"Hah" Hubert said only it wasn't loud at all this time not even short.
Then he said "Hah.
Hah.
Hah" and not loud either.
Then he said "Well."
Then he said "Well well."
Then he said "We'll check up foinute.
Iin you take Sibbey withouowry and the two niggers anont owe 'Filus anything.
If you win—" "—Theophilus is free" Uncle Buddy said.
"And you owe him the three hundred dollars for Tomey's Turl."
"That's just iall you" Hubert said.
"Iont call you 'Filus wont owe me nothing anont owe 'Filus nothing unlesake that nigger whicave been trying to explain to you and him both for yearont have on my place.
We will be right back where all this foolishness started from except for that.
So what it comes down to iither got to givigger away or risk buying one that you done already admitted you cant keep at home."
Then he stopped talking.
For abouinute it was like he and Uncle Buddy had both gone to sleep.
Then Hubert picked up his face-down card and turned it over.
It was another three and Hubert sat there without looking at anything at all his fingers beatinattoo slow and steady and not very loud on the table.
"H'm" he said.
"And you neerey and there aint but four of them anlready got three.
And you just shuffled.
Anut afterward.
And iall yoill have to buy that nigger.
Who dealt these cards Amodeusnly he didn't wait to be answered.
He reached out and tilted the lamp-shade the light moving up Tomey's Turl's arms that were supposed to be black but were not quite white up his Sunday shirt that was supposed to be white but wasn't quite either that he put on every time he ran away just as Uncle Buck put on the necktie each time he went to bring him back and on to his face; and Hubert sat there holding the lampshade and looking at Tomey's Turl.
Then he tilted the shade back down and took up his cards and turned them face-down and pushed them across the middle of the table.
"I pass Amodeus" he said.
He was still too worn out for sleep to sit oorse so this time he and Uncle Buddy and Tennie all three rode in the wagon while Tomey's Turl led the pony from old Jake.
And when they got home just after daylight this time Uncle Buddy never even had time to get breakfast started and the fox never even got out of the crate because the dogs were right there in the room.
Old Moses went right into the crate with the fox so that both of them went right—right on out through the back end of it.
That is the fox went through because when Uncle Buddy opened the door to come in old Moses was still wearing most of the crate around his neck until Uncle Buddy kicked it off him.
So they made just one run across the front gallery and around the house and they could hear the fox's claws when—when he went scrabbling up the lean-pole onto the roof—a fine race while it lasted but—but the tree was too quick.
"What in damn's hell do you mean" Uncle Buddy said "casting that damn thing with the dogs right in the same roomDamn the fox" Uncle Buck said.
"Go on and start breakfast.
It seems to me I've been away from homhole damn month."
John Longley Jr. Let's givnd  's voicoment's rest and—and he has told me that he'll be glad to have questions.
And so we'll take abouive-minute break and then havuestion period.
John Longley Jrhinill be very interested to see what questions you might have to ask him so go right ahead and volunteer.
are you playinind of fugue on the theme of races here?
Are you havinot of fun with that haot of fun with itasn't playinugue on the theme of racesas writing about people in what I—what to me was amusing terms anoped it would be amusing terms to the reader.
No it was primarily about people about people who had got into a—a predicament and solved it with the only tools they had.
Yes sir.
this iittle bit off the theme of literature but I'd like to—if you wouldn't mind tell uittle about your trip to Greece?hinould like to heaittle about that if that's not getting too far off the subject too far away from it.
It was a—a strange experience in that that was the only country that looked exactly like—we had—I mean the—the background the—the educational background of—of the Anglo-Saxon had taught him to expect it to look.
And sure enough there was the Hellenic light thaad heard of had read about.
Anaw Homer's wine-dark sea too.
And there was a—the only placas in where there waense oery distant past but there was nothing inimical in it.
In the other parts of—of the Old World there'ense of—of the past but there is something—something Gothic—Gothic and iensittle terrifying.
In Greece the people seem to function against that past that for all its—its remoteness in time it was—was still inherent in the—the—the light the resurgence of spring.
You didn't expect to see the—the ghost of—of the old Greeks or expect to see the actual figures of the gods but you haense that they—they were near and they were still powerful not inimical just—just powerful.
That they themselves had—had reached and were enjoying a—a kind oirvana.
They existed but they were free of—of man's folly and trouble of having to involve themselves in man's problem.
That they were—at last had the time to watch what man did without having to be involved in it.
Yes it was—was very interesting.
I—I think that—that two weeks is not only too short it's an insult to that country that one should go with—with no limit to his visit.
That there's no end to what you can see and then sure enough you see something which is exactly like what you imagined.
There will be the plain and—and across it suddenly there is Parnassus with snow on it and the old ruins—they look ancient but there'ense as though it happened only yesterday.
That whether Agamemnon ever lived ever was an actual man or not there he was he—because he had to be.
It was necessary.
That he—he was in the literary history of man's spirit so therefore he must have existed at one time alesh and blood man.
Yes sir.
in your new book The Town you have Flem Snopes assuming the mask of respectability.
Anas wondering since yohink are going to writrilogy that—I was wondering what type of character would Flem Snopes assume say in your next booke had never heard of respectability.
He didn't even know it existed until suddenly  he found that he needed it.
And so he assumed it and as soon as he doesn't need respectability any longer he will cast it away.
That he haertain aim which he intended to attain.
He would use whatever tools necessary with complete ruthlessness to gain that end.
And if he had to use respectability he would use that.
If he had to use religious observance he would use that.
If he has to destroy his wife he will do that.
If he has to—to trick a—a—a chilirl child into—to being his tool he will do that with no compunction whatever.
That respectability to him was jusoolYes sir.Mask you to what extent when you're composing your stories are your characters— do they represent ideas oheme consciously on your part or to what extent are they just people who keep developing as characters and let theme and plot fall where they mayes the character comes first as people.
I—I didn't have enough formal education to—to know really what ideas are that ideas to me must be translated into—to the human being struggling against his own problems.
The ideas are only incidental or maybe coincidental to writing about people and the—the ideas of the—the symbolism they are simply in my own case the tools which the craftsman uses to tell the story but his interest is primarily in the characters not in the plot not really so much in what they do but it's in—in making the—the—the figure of his imagination assume three dimensions and stand on its own feet and cast its own shadow.
The symbolism the style the ideas are only coincidental to that and are simply the tools which the craftsman uses.But would—would you say then sir that you have to—you would begin with an idea foharacter rather than an anecdote or an ideaell—Of an eventt could be an anecdote ocene but it would be not an idea.
It would be people in motion people in some tragic or comic situation struggling to get out of it or it could be—come—the first conception would be the character itself.For example this story you read us this evening do you recall—this is probably so far bacondered though what was the germ of that story?
Do you recall it perhapshe germ of the story was one of the three oldest ideas that—that man can write about which is—is love sex.
And to me it was—was comic of the man that had got himself involved in an engagement and he himself couldn't extricate himself and his—  he had to call on his brother and his brother used the only tools he had which was his ability to play poker.
Which to me what was funny.
It was funny.
Also it was—it haertain sociological importance in to show my country as it really was in those days.
The—the—the elegance of the colonial plantation didn't exist in my country.
My country was still frontier.
The plantation the—the—the columned porticos that was Charleston and Natchez.
But in my country it was still frontier.
People lived from day to day with a—witluff and crude hardiness but with a—a certain simplicity which to me is very interesting because the—the common picture of the South is all magnolias and crinoline and—and Grecian portals and things like that which was true only around the fringes of the South not in the interior the backwoods.
Yes sir.
to what extent have you drawn directly on experience for these storieshat's difficult to say.
The writehink has three reservoirs one is experience which includes what he has read.
The other is observation which of course is what he has seen and done.
The third is imagination.
And he himself doesn't know and in fact he hasn't gotten time to be concerned or to care how much of which he draws on at any one time.
It's as though he had three reservoirs with three pipes that go tommon tap with maybe a—an automatic selector somewhere that—that when—when observation doesn't go far enough it tries experience.
When experience hasn't gone far enough it reverts to imagination that the only check is some rigid concept of what is truth and what is not truth in—in the craftsman which what he does has got to match.
If it doesn't match he throws it away and then he's got to—to go back to imagination.
If that is not enough then he's got to—to increase his experience or his observation.
But no man can say just how much of—of each he uses.
He knows any writer that he is going to change and alter anything he writes because any fiction writer iongenital liar to begin with you see.
He is not going to—to take anything as is.
He's going to change it.
Yes sir.Have you enjoyed your stay here at the Universityes sir very much.We were interested in your comment of—of coming to Virginia because you liked snobonder if you might care to—   Well that was—I thought that we were more or less informal then anidn't really mean that aerious observation.
But—  Now let me define whaean bnob is someone who is so complete in himself and so satisfied with what he has that he needs nothing from anybody.
That whetranger comes up he can accept that stranger on the stranger's terms provided only the stranger observe onlew amenities of civilization.
And to me that—that's what the people what Virginians do.
They don't—they never push at me.
They want nothing of me.
They—they will—will offer me their hospitability and they will—will accept me.
Alave to do is just to behave decently.
Yes sir.Sir is there any one incident in your life that you just decided then that you were going to becomriter was living in New Orleansas running a—a power boat foootleggerould go down  and take the boat with a—a—a man witun and a—a—a—Negro hand for the crew through the industrial canal across the—the Mississippi Sound to an island where the schooner would bring the raw alcohol up from the Indies and we would load the cargo and bring it back to town.
I'd geundred dollars for each trip and in those days that waot of money souldn't have to work untiegan to run out of money.
Theould make another run with the boat anet Sherwood Anderson aniked him at once.
We would meet and walk around the French Quarter and he would talk anould listen.
We would meet again in the evening.
We'd go to some pleasant courtyard and we'd sit oveottle of whiskey and he would talk anould listen.
In the mornings he would be in seclusion working.
That went on day after day anhought if—if that's all you had to do to briter then that was the life for me  secideanted to becomriter antarteook and right awaound it was fun to do anadn't seen  Anderson in weeksenderson on the street and she said "We haven't seen you.aid "Yes'm I'm writinook."
She said "Good God."
audience laughteaw her agaiew weeks later.
She said "I told Anderson—Sherwood you were writinook.
She says "Dant him  Anderson to read it?
'aid "Well'm he can if he wants to."
She said "Well he told me to tell you he'll makrade with you.
If he don't have to read that manuscript he'll tell his publisher to take it."
Said "done."
Aninished the manuscript and he told his publisher to take it and that's hoot to brofessional writer.
But of course by that time I'd found that writing was fun.
It was—was—was the most fun I'd found yet annew then thaad been bitten and was incurable.
Yes sir.I was wondering how long you can write—for how long atretch can you write before you feel tired before you've tired yourself outou get tirehink before you realize itooeaf from—from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes when she says "Always leave him while you're looking good."
Well I—I always try to remind myself to stop before I'm—have found out I'm tired but as long as it's hot it's—it's difficult to break off and—and quit.
That takeertain amount of discipline to stop and always leave something fresh to start on tomorrow.
That's the only rule about writinave is never to write completely out at one stretch.
That could be an hour or sixteen hours iay though there're some workmen that—that have to havigid discipline.
They sit so many houray whether they write anything or not.
They do research.
They have notebooks and they—they takiece of paper and—and ploraph for the story to follow which I've never done because I'm lazy and I—I don't like the effort of putting the words on the paper sut that on—put that off as long as possible anreat deal of that is—is done here befortart to write.
John Longley Jr. Did you havuestiones sir.I havuestion I've always wanted to ask an author is do they really put all the significance and meaning and trying to teach this big lesson in the book and I—I had thought that you answered it once but then you seem to contradict yourself.
Do you write to try to teach somebodesson to describe your state or just because you think you've got to writood story and make some money off of ito no.
All that is incidental.
What the writer is—is—is doing is trying to create people.
He hasn't got time to bother with the symbols and the message.
The first-rate writer hasn't.
He is busy creating people and he would do that even if he had to pay for the privilege.
He's not interested in the money.
The money is—is incidental too that he is having a—a good time creating living people.And that's motive enough to writookh yehink so.
Actually he's—he's demon-driven.
The—the writer who is trying to—to telessage is not primarilriter.
He is—he's more of an—an evangelist oropagandist maybe.
But—but the writer the—the true fictioneer is interested only in creating human beings.Then coulsk you what Ike Snopes is supposed to be in—in The Hamlet?
What were you creating then?
Is he someone like whom—like someone whom you knew or what?
I—  No no.
No writer is satisfied with—with the folks that God creates.
He's convinced that he can do much better than that.
To me Ike Snopes was simply an interesting human being with—with man's natural normal failings his—the baseness which man fights against the—the honor which he hopes that he can always match.
The honesty the courage which he hopes that he can always match.
And at times he fails.
And then he is—he is pitiable.
But he's still human and he still believes that man can be better than he is and that is what the writer is—is trying to do is interested in to—to show man as he is in conflict with his problems with his nature with his own heart with his fellows and with his environment.
That's all I—in my opinion any book or story is about.
Of course it has mutations.
The problems fall into the categories of money or sex or death.
But the—the basic story is man in conflict with his own heart with his fellows or with his environment.
Yes sir.
is there any special reason why you consider Wolfe sucreat authorhat was an unfortunate remarade about twenty years ago that I've been explaining ever since.
It was at a—a group meeting something like this.
Someone asked me hoated my contemporariesaid it's too soon to rate us we haven't finished yet.
He said "Well you have—haven't you any opinion at all about them said "About whoe named Wolfe Dos Passos Caldwell and Hemingwayaid "Well" and this was sort of off the cuffever thought of it beforeaid "Well I—I think we all failed and sould rate them on the—the splendor of the failure.ut Wolfe first because he made the—the—the most splendid failureut myself secondut Dos Passos third Caldwell fourth and Hemingway fifth.
It had nothing to do with the value of the work we'd done but on the—on the splendor with which we had failedut Hemingway last because he had found quickly a—a method in which he was secure and he didn't need to splash around to experiment that he stuck to that and he didn't—didn't need to—to try to—to put all the history of man's heart onto one pinhead and one paragraph which Wolfe had tried to do which is why Wolfe's material would have been unreadable had it not been for his editor  Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's and  Perkins in—iay really wrote Wolfe's book because the mass of incoherent material that—which Wolfe sent to him would've been unreadable  if it hadn't been for  Perkins.
Yes sir.Sir you say that your characters are and as much as possible anyway just people.
And yeort of got the idea that Flem Snopes is sort of a—a practically inhuman character and sort of symbolic himself.
Does that ever—did that enter when you wrote that or—  Well it would depend on what he is symbolic of.
You see people who are inhuman peoplehink thaidn't invent an inhuman—the inhuman type which— which Flem is a—a manifestation ofhink that Jason Compson in another book of mine is—is completely inhuman.
But iay he iopiving manave known people in actual life who were hopeless who in—in the terms of—of—of the humanities in the terms of—of the—of the verities of—of man's condition compassion and pity and courage unselfishness—he was inhuman but he was stiliving man.
He was not created to bymbol of anything.
He was simply created because suddenly he halace in—in that particular scene thaas writing about in that particular problem of human beings thaas writing about.
Not to symbolize anything at all.
Yes sir.Sir do you believe that the theory of absurdity is applicable to man himself doubt inderstand you.
You'll have to explaiittle more what you mean by that.Well the theory of absurdity implies that man is completely unintelligent.
He—it's absurd for him to ever ...  Oee.Putting myself on the plane of being or to come in contact with God or anything like that.
Non't.
That would take a—a different mentality from mine to accept man as absurd.
He is ridiculous at times.
He is—he is nothing consistently absurd except these—these exceptions we spoke of who are inhuman and who are—are—are devils but in general man is capable of—of absurdity just as he's capable of grandeur but he is not consistently capable of any.
My belief is that he wants to be consistently capable always of—of the best things of—of—of grandeur of courage of compassion of honesty but he fails.
But—but to me he's not absurd.
It's only in his—his ephemeral manifestation of the moment.ould say as a—as—as an idea someone with the capacity to read English that appeared suddenly with no past mature out oacuum would get nothing from reading the books that he would have to have something in his own experience of—of man and man's condition and man's behavior to have made the books comprehensible to him so of course he reads into the—the books things the writer didn't put in there in the terms that—that his and the writer's experience could not possibly be identical.
That there are things the writer might think is in that book which the reader doesn't find for the same reason that—that no two experiences can be identical but everyone reads according to—to his own—own lights his own experience his own observation imagination and experience.
Yes sir.Most of us here tonighhink are rather young men in—in the field of engineeringot of us hope to be getting out this yearonder if you have—this may be an offbeat question—I wonder if you have any advice to young men getting ready to go out in the light you might say  from the point of view of someone who's studied human beings and people as much as you have.
There waery wise man said to me once "I never give anybody advice because they might take it."
And at firsidn't understand what he meant by that but—but nohino.
Actually nobody can bathe for you you know.
You've got to do that yourself  and the experience the—the advice you gehink is not by asking for it.
You—you get that through some form of osmosis.
You will get it from the books you read from your experiences in college.
Every man has got to stand on his own feet anhink now thaouldn't accept anyone's advice thaould rather make my own mistakes than to accept advice which—which might save me becausnow now that—that mistakes don't hurt you.Well that's good advice in itselhink.
Well thank you.Sir—  Yes sir.If you were to undertakiography what characteristics would you consider wouldn't undertake one for the reasoust stated before that any writer worth his salt is convinced he can improve on anything that God ever made.
audience laughteould never write my own becausnow beinongenital liaever could tell the truth about things.
Yes sir.Sir if you were to writook based around the University here what sort of characters and situations  would you put in itow that question iay has been answered before.
The writinave done has always been from the character.
Now if the character thahought of said "I'm going to go to the University of Virginia" theould have to write about the University of Virginia but the character would have to command tharite about the University of Virginia.
It's—it's not in—in my line of work to say "Now I'm going to writtory about any place" and then put people into it that the people themselves say "Come on here  we're going to write this one about the University of Virginia."
Yes sir.I—someone who talked to you gavist of virtues.
I've heard you mention some of them tonight.
Do you have that ready?
audience laughtehink that courage and honesty were among your list of virtues.
Well let's use a—a little better word to me than virtues.
They're the verities of the human heart.
They are courage honor pride compassion pity.
That they are—they are not virtues.
One doesn't try to practice them in my opinion simply because they are good.
One practices—tries to practice them simply because they are the edifice on which the whole history of man has been founded and by means of which his—aace he has endured this long.
That without—without those verities he would have vanished just like the mastodon and the other ephemeral phenomena of nature which have come and gone in the history of the world.
Man has endured despite his frailty because he accepts and believes in those verities that one must be honest not because it's—it's—it's virtuous but because that's the only way to get along.
That if people lied constantly to one another you would never know where you were you would never know what was going on.
That if people didn't practice compassion there would be nothing to defend the weak until they got enough strength to stand for themselves.
If one didn't practice something of—of pride one would have nothing to be proud about to have said "I—I did well.
I—I did nothing thaas ashamed ofan lie down with myself and sleep."
That is they are—they are the verities to be practiced not because they arirtue but because that's the best way to live in peace with yourself and your fellows.
Yes sir.Sir what ioan toothh it was a—probablead tooth that had turneluish color which to this little boy was the color of roan horse.
That was the first color he thought of that it waead tooth in this lady's mouth here that haluish cast or purplish cast to it.
John Longley Jr. Well let's have one more question fond then we'll close down for the night.
Yes ... asuestion.
Yes sir.In some of your bookave noticed the characters tend to be sort of blanks.
You don't know what they areood example of this is Sutpen in Absalom Absalom!
He'lank until the end of the book.
You don't know what motivates him.
You see him motivated; you see him doing these things but you don't see what motivates him.
Do you start with knowing what the character is and describe his motivations describe his actions and then get around to describing what motivates the actionso it is—is the writer's fault.
Before the writer begins to put that character down he has got to understand him and if he hasn't made perfectly plain and coherent the motivations necessary to make that character real to the reader then the—the writer himself is at fault.
He hasn't probably learned enough of his craft by that time.
But to the writer of course that character is—is intact and whole and is breathing and is standing up and if to the reader he doesn't stand up and is not real and actual then that is the fault of the craftsman.I didn't say—he's real and actual anealize this buon't see the reasons for his actions until the—until the very end of the bookust didn't see why he did these thingsee that he did them annew there waeason for it buidn't know what it was.
Well you can meet an actual living creature or man you can see him in the throes of some action and it won't be until after the action is complete that you'll find out why he did that.
You agree to that that that's possible?
Yeah.
Well that's the case of Sutpen.
It's—simply waatter of—of—of where you happened to be standing where the reader happened to be standing that he didn't—the observer happened to be standing that he didn't see the motives in time.
Now that—that can be used as a—arick to be more effectiveon't remember if—if that was my intent then but that is a—a valid trick which—which applies one of the simple primary rules of—of writing any paragraph which is emphasis.
Yes ma'am.I was wondering you said that in your list of the five authors you thought you had all failed anondered just what it was you thought you had failed at and what you thought if there is suching as successh it—I mean by it this that what saves any artist any writer is that he will never quite attain the image the shape the dream.
It's always out of his reach.
If he ever attained it then he would be miserable for the rest of his life but he never quite matches that so he writes again and again and again and that's—that's why the—the artist's life is sucappy one.
He never does reach satiety.
He never will.
He will believe that next time he will write the thing that will match that—that marvelous dream that he has but—but he knows he won't.
But he will still try.
There's always some reason for him to wake up tomorrow morning.
There's something to do.
That's why he's the happiest man of all of them.And do you think that each new book is better than the old oneell to me there're no degrees.
It's either good or it's—it's bad  and it's got to be perfect then I'll say it's good.
But there are not degrees of it.
The only consistent opinioave is that it's another failure neither good nor bad.
It just—it jusailure.
But nevehameful failure.
It's—it's when the—the book was basely conceived and executed it failed.
That's the shameful failure.
That is something to writhe over but just a—a decent honest failure is all right because aust said failure and mistakes never hurt you.
Nothing to—to dread or fear or—or dodge is an opportunity in which you might makistake.
There's nothing to be ashamed of in that nothing to hurt you.
John Longley Jr. Well ladies and gentleman thank you for your interesting and intelligent questions.
Thank youpplause A. K. Davis We all know why we're here and we're very lucky to be here witnd that's all I'll say and ask you to begin.
Any questions you want to askBogghere's beeot of talk about the—some kind of Southern Renascence an outburst of creativity in the Southonder—from your own experience—you have any ideas on why it should come at this time or is there oneon't because I'm—I'm not very literary and don't keep up with things like that.
Somebody said that—that southerners don't read books they write books.
Maybe that's all it is but I—I can't say unless it may be that until the last war southerners never got away from home.
Their only chance to—to adventure was in the imagination.
Their only chance for—for change for a—an experience that was romantic and—and interesting was to invent it and put it down on paper.
I'm not too certain thaelieve that very much myself but that's the sort of thing .... A. K. Davis It's been both stated and denied that Sir Walter Scott has greatly influenced southern people especially during the—not the recent unpleasantness but the less recent unpleasantness the mid-nineteenth century war the War Between the Statesotice you name one of your characters Quentin aather romantic-minded individual.
Do yousuggest by that name that he is the type of southerner who was influenced by the kind of things that Walter Scott—  Not necessarilyhink that—that Scott was read more in the South for the reason that aime the southerner had very little of his money to devote to the buying of books and there wainship perhaps between the—the life of—of—of—of Scott's Highland and the—the life the—the southerner led after Reconstruction.
They too were—were in the aftermath of a—oand which had been conquered and devastated by people—people speaking its own language which hasn't happened too many times.
And so every southern household when they bought books they—they bought Scotteckon it was because you got more words for your money maybe could have had something to do with that.
But every household that all—that at all pretended to be literate had Scott.That's true.While we are on that literary angle which we dreamed uittle bit on the literary side do you feel that the—the subject  Boggs raised about the literary renaissance or whatever you want to call it the flourishing of literature in the South has been in any notable way indebted to the fact thaumber of young people writers were resident in Paris came under French influence perhaps in the Twenties don't know.
It seems to me that—that very few southerners werart of that group of expatriates of the Twenties in Paris.
Most of the onenew were—were northernerson't remembeingle southerner that had any part in itould say that the reasons for the renaissance in southern writing was in the—the cards in the making long before thathink this may have haittle to do with it since the Civil War there has been a—a great deal of—misunderstanding is not quite the right word the northerner the outlander had a—a queer and erroneous idea of—of what southern people were.
It may be that that was an instinctive desire in southerners to—to tell the—the outlander just what we were just what we might have had that—that we felt was—was worth accepting four years of war in which we knew we had no chance to win it to say this is what we had that we thought was worth that or this is what we actually areon't know.
That—that's probably valid.
I—I imagine there are so many things that went into it that probably nobody could say "This is where the resurgence of writing in the South came from.yself am inclined to think it was because of the—the—the barrenness of the southerner's life that he had to resort to his own imagination to—to create his own Carcassonne.In that connection—  ...—would you mind commenting on this question?
You—you saiinute ago facetiously that southerners don't read books they write them.
It has long been known of course to literary historians that southern writers both before and after the Civil War counted pretty largely on northern readers.
And Hayne for example waotable example.
Lanier is another example.
Do you suppose that has been in the consciousness of the average southern writer and could possibly have influenced his work in any wayes it has.
It's in his consciousness that the man that will publish his book iortherner and he—he is never unaware of that that the publisher and—and to an extent his readers are northernershink that most southerners know that his—his home folks ain't going to like what he writes anyway that he's not really writing to them and that—and that they simply do not read books.
They are good people but they just do not read books.The clash sir between the explanations of the South does that help square the fact that the explanations offered are not always greeted with warmth in the South itselfaave your specific question again?
I—I got two or three different ideas there.Whaeant was that if—if part of the renascence in southern writers is due to an urge to explain the southern—the South to explain itself is it not also true that once one gets out of the moonlight and magnolias school that various of the non-writing southerners do not like what the writing southerners do or the picture they presentes that's quite true.
The—the non-writing southerner the non-reading southerner he wants the sort of brochure that the Chamber of Commerce gets out.
There are things in his country that he's not too proud of himself but—but to him it's bad manners to—to show that in public.
A. K. Davis Does any locality like to read the books that are written about that locality do you think?
Is it characteristic thaocality is—is generally offended when it finds itself iovel otoryhe—an element of the locality but didn't the people of his own country have a—a sort of a—a fierce pride in people like Thoreau and Emerson?
Or was that just the—the educated intellectual New Englander that felt that?
A. K. Davion't know—  Wellways thought that—that everybody they might not have approved so much of all that—that Emerson or Thoreau said but they had a—a—a fierce almost provincial pride in— A. K. Davis They did but neither Emerson nor Thoreau were writing about the people of New England in the way we're talking about in the way you write about the people of the South or Eudora Welty or whoever.
They were writing about ideas and nature but as far anow they didn't write about—they didn't give pictures of the locality that is—is to saythis is what things are like in New England.
I—I think I'm right aren't I?
You'd have to go to Hawthorne wouldn't you to find— A. K. Davis You'd have to go to Hawthorne to find if the—the—  Would that have held true of Hawthorne?
A. K. Davion't know siron't know whether that—whether Hawthorne would have been perceived .......
Anyway as far as that's concerned as far anow he was just as popular at home as he was anywhere else.
Well that gets back to something else.
Caan write about ideas except in—in the provincial terms of his background?
A. K. Davis Well they certainly must affect him.
Could Emerson have—have written Emerson—would it have been the same Emerson if he'd beeississippian say oexan oalifornian?
A. K. Davis Welhink not but still when you are writing about self-reliance in general it could apply all over the world.
But woulalifornian ilimate that don't change where you don't need  evearm house to live in—what would he care about self-reliance?
That reminds—that—that brings up this question my mind thaften—Carlyle says Walt Whitman—he says "Walt Whitman thinks that because he lives iig country he'ig man."
What do you suppose—I—I gather that he thought that Whitman thought that the climate and the general landscape background of—the geographical features olace had some influence on the—on the person who grows up in that whether he briter or not.
Do you suppose there's anything in that?
In the South for example what—how does that turn out in the Southelould say that—that Carlyle's and Whitman's definition oig man were completely different.
Carlyle's an islander—a small country.
His idea oig man is a—iig individual manhould think that Whitman's idea oig man is one that is lucky enough to belong tace of giants that he's one tooonder if Whitman believed that he waigger man than anybody else in America.Whaas getting at was whether the peculiarities of Southern climate and topography might possibly have any influence on the nature of the writingt would have to just like the language the man knows to write in would have some influence on him.
Buon't think that the—that the topography—one topography will producriter where another topography won't.
But of course—You don't think there's any relationship then between the lack of roads in Yoknapatawpha County and the difficulties of your sentence structureo sir  because—because the lack of—the lack of roads in Yoknapatawpha County ain't near as complex as—as Madison Avenue or 42nd Street.
Though of course that depends upon who is looking at each one.
Yoknapatawpha County ain't near as complex as the Empire State Building.
A. K. Davi spoke to you about your long sentences and asked you if one reason for them were not that you were trying to give the past and the present and the future more or less all at the same time to throw light on the present action by referring to the past and to the future.
Annderstand why throwing light on the past would throw light oresent action.
Anhinnderstand why reference to the future would do it.
Bum not sure thao understand anould like to ask you why you—you feel it is necessary to bring in the future while you are telling the present.
Why—why the—why is that significant?
It's not going to happen yet.
So why—why bring in something that has not yet happened while you are recounting something that is happeningelan's future is inherent in that man.
I—in the sense that—that life A.D. 1957 is—is not the end of life that there'll be a—a 2057.
That we assume that.
There may not be but we assume that.
And in man in man's behavior today is 1950—2057.
If we just haachine that could project ahead and could capture that that machine could—could isolate and—and freeze a—a picture an image of what man will be doing in 2057 just as—as the machine might capture and fix the light rays showing what he was doing in—in B.C.
28.
That is that's the mystical belief that—that there is no such thing as "was."
That—that time "is" and if there's no such thing as "was" then there is no such thing as "will be."
That time is a—is a—noixed condition that time is iay—iay the sum of the combined intelligences of all men who breathe at that moment.
A. K. Davis So you—so you arrogate to yourself the power of knowing the future of your characters and use that in your depicting of them and what happens to them.
No— A. K. Davis You—you are iense in 2057 and you're writing about somebody in 1957 and you also know what happened in 1857.
Well I—I can assume the fact that—that in the people whicreate is the—the genesis the—the seed of 2057on't know it anon't thineed to know it.
But the people behave according to the—the—the pattern by which man has been able to endure this long.
Then if he holds to that pattern he will continue to endure assuming that there's not some—some tremendous cataclysmic explosion which will wreck everything.
That the—the verities which are true now will be true in 2057 and man will—will go through the same struggle to—to live up to them to behave as he—he wants to behave whether he can or not whether he fails or not.
That his problems really won't be any different.
The important problems won't be any different in 2057 than they are now.
A. K. Davis I—I was thinking of somethinittle more specific than—than that.
You—you are talking abouan brushing his hair and you refer to the fact that twenty years ago he wahild playing in the dust and at the same time you know he's going to commiurder up here.
And you bring in the murder and you bring in the playing in the dust and you bring in the combing of his hair all together we will say aee it in—in one passage in one—one sentence.
Oee what you mean.
Well of course the writer arrogates to himself that right to know the future of his own people.
He don't know the future of the human race but he does know the future of—of—of that individual that character or he never could get his book done.
That is he has got to know where the thing's going iay before he starts because then he won't know when to stop it.
A. K. Davis And you think this future murder throws light on the way this fellow—  Yes yes.
A. K. Davis —combs his hair and the playing in the dust—  Yes yes.
A. K. Davis —also throws light on the way he combs his hair and you can describe the combing of the hair the better because—hink so.
A. K. Davis —you have this in mind and that in mind.hink if—if we could know the future of ourselves and one another we would never be as baffled and confused by—by people by our contact with people as we are.
It wouldn't be as much fun of course but— A. K. Davis Didn't you havuestion you wanted to ask in connection with Dostoevsky the Russians in general?
... let me figuray to—to phrase it and get it clear in my mind ... in so longon't know...Well what—what do you think is the—was the difference in quality of the impact on the—to the southern people after the Civil War and the—aental experience and though—and say World War I—the people that were involved in World War I would say possibly it was—was sharpearder experience because for—for years the southerner had lived a—a safe and isolated life in which nothing actually had happened to him except the—the simple things of—of crop failures and—and trouble with—with his own particular plantation economy.
The Civil War was—wareat deal ohock to him because suddenly it thrust him into the world.
He had to becomember not olass or of a—a provincial segment buember of the whole human race.
When he got into the second World War he had gotten used to having to bember of the human race whether he wanted to or not and so that wasn't as much shock.
Also if anybody did he won that war.
That is he was on the side that was succesful.
In the Civil War the southerner was on the side that lost.I suppose my question in reference to Dostoevsky boils down to this.
Why do you consider Benjood tool in the—the telling of this story one of the—the instruments in telling the story?
The same question why do you often use children who are quite young and not much of a—the one in—Vardaman.
Is it possibly because the idiot and the child are free of any preconceived ideas about the truth?
They have no convention.
They haven't had any religion to fog them or anything like that.
They're sort of open-minded and free.
And are they better judges of the truth?
Can they see the truth better than the more sophisticated and more intelligent human beingsnly in this sense say there wairror which would obliterate everything from the image it reflected except—except the verities.
To me that is the child.
As you say it has less trash that it—it has had to—to assimilate and live with in order to—to cope with the adult world.
It—it sees with a—nolearer eye that's not the worant—but it—it is incapable of seeing the things which are—which are not true which don't match the verities which the adult has been trained and had to learn so that he no longer knows that—that he—what he sees is—is obfuscated.
The child don't even know that it doesn't see something that the adult sees.
And what the child sees is closer to the verities the important thingshink that's—the most interesting thing to write about is the child as it learns to cope with the adult world which it didn't create that it's got to learn to—to live with in order to—to endure to get along to have enough to eat and how it makes those adjustments how it gradually comes to believe that—that—that lies are truths.
It—it don't know that it is coming to believe that.
It just has to learn that or die.
And when it's stilhild it doesn't know yet.
It hasn't had to believe that lies are truth.
To the child the lie is stilie and the truth is truth.
Benjy the idiot—he waublimated idiot probably but he had some of that quality.
He had the child's quality to—to see and recognize only the truth but he haan's long years of—of simple experience whether he could assimilate that experience or not.
He haonger time to see that more human beings were capable of believing that—that lies were true than the child of three or four or five or six.
Edgar Shanno think it'ery interesting point you raise and—and—but how do you reconcile that view of the—of the child whichink is the correct one and agreeable to me with the other aspects of the child as children are very often the most savage to each other hurt each other have—have less sensitivity toward each other than—than adults do.
Whereas they sometimes seem to perceive the truth seem to cut through so much of the—the sham that adults build up still we have to educate children to be—on the whole to be considerate.
Well that savagery that ruthlessness that's one of the verities.
It's noirtue but it—it'erity.
To me there's—there'istinction between verity and virtue.
Some of the verities when they are practiced the practice of them becomes virtue.
The child is—is incapable of being clubbed up by your shibboleth "you musn't do this because it's wrong."
The child says "I will do this becausant to" and he tries to do it.
That in—that—that—that'ruth in—in the world too that—that man can be inhuman to man.
It'erity.
It's—it's a—a vice when practiced but it's one of the verities.
Just like—like honor and honesty.You have various children.
You spoke of Benjy.
There is—and also of The Sound and the Fury and Vardamanas thinking—been thinking recently about this boy who participates in the telling of the story in The Townon't know—I'm not sure thanow how you would explain the function of Charles Mallison in—in this last novel whether he has—whether he is—his part of the story is supposed to have any particular value because he ihild or—and—and whether—and then Ratliff—there are three people you see.
There is yourself and I—I'm—I haven't been able to see at the moment and I've only read it one time quite as well ao in The Sound and the Fury the distinct values which come from the three points of viewon't know whethem making myself clear or not.
You can comment on that problem.
That's—was simply a—a—welon't like the word "trick" but it was used deliberately to look at—at the—the object from three points of view.
Just as when you—you examine a—a monument you will walk around it.
You are not satisfied to look at it from just one side.
Also it—to look at it from—from three different mentalities.
That was—one was the mirror which obliterated all except truth because the mirror didn't know the other factors existed.
Another was to look at it from the point of view of—of someone who had made of himselore or less artificial man through his desire to practice what he had been told wairtue apart from his belief in virtues what he had been told trained by his respect for education in the old classical sense.
The other was from the point of view oan who—who practiced virtue from simple instinct from—from—well more than that because—foractical reason because it was better.
There was less confusion if all people didn't tell lies to one another and didn't pretend.
That seemed to me to givore complete picture of the specific incidents as they occurred if they could be expressed three times.And yet you didn't mean that Charles Mallison was quite as much ohild or an innocent as some of these other childrenell he changed.
He grew up in that book.
And of course his point of view changed.One other question about that book.
Someone has said recently—anon't present this as my view it is something that—thaould like you to comment on if you will—that Gavin Stevens in The Town iess maturess responsible somehow or otheess likable person than he appears in some other places as in the stories of Knight's Gambit.
Well he had got out of his depth—depth.
He had got into—to the real world.
While he was—could be—a county attorney an amateur Sherlock Holmes then he was at home but—but he got out of that.
He got into a—a real world in which people anguished and suffered not simply did things which they shouldn't do.
And he wasn't as prepared to cope with people who were following their own bent not for profit but simply because they had to.
That is he kneood deal less about people than he knew about the law and about the weighing of evidence and—and drawing the right conclusions from what he—he saw with his legal mind.
When he—when he had to deal with people he was an amateur.
He was—at times he haood deal less judgment than his nephew did.
Which is—is not against education as probably the passion he had for getting degrees for trying this and trying that and going all the way to Europe to get more degrees to study more was—was in his own nature.
It was the same character that made him shy away from marriage.
He was probably afraid to be married.
He might get too involved with the human race if he married one of them.
Did you mean Gavin Stevens to be like that in Intruder in the Dusto'm.
These people I—I invent and after thaust run along and put down what they say and doon't know always what they are going to develop into myself.I mean is Gavin at the same stage of development in Intruder in the Dust?
Is he younger in The Townntruder in the Dust happened after The Town.
Intruder in the Dust happened about 1935 or '40 and The Town began in—in 1909 and went to 1927.
Probably Stevens learned something from The Town to carry into Intruder in the Dust.
the fight that Gavin has with de Spain in The Town reminded me in some ways of the fight that Quentin had when he was in Cambridge.
They both seemeittle bit like Don Quixote—  Yes.—fighting for the honor oady.
Is there any such similarity there in character between the two men at that timeo that's—that'onstant sad and—and funny picture too.
It is the knight that goes out to defend somebody who don't want to be defended and don't need it.
But it'ery fine quality in—in human natureope it will always endure.
It is comical anittle sad and Quentin and Stevens were that much alike.
what did you start with in Intruder in the Dust?
Was it the idea oingle character or ...ell it began with the notion—there waremendous flux of detective stories going about at that time and my children were always buying them and bringing them home.
I'd stumble over them everywherent.
Anhought of an idea for one would ban in jail just about to be hung that would have to be his own detective.
He couldn't get anybody to help him.
Then the next thought was the man for that would begro.
Then the character of—of Lucas—Lucas Beauchamp came along.
And the book came out of that.
It was the notion oan in jail who couldn't hiretective couldn't hire one of these tough guys that slapped women around  and toorink every time he couldn't think of what to say next.
But onchought of Beauchamp then he took charge of the story and the story waood deal different from the idea that—of the detective story thaad started with.Sir speaking of technique and the way characters are handled somebody's accused you of going to school to Joyce.
Would you mind commenting on his and perhaps any other individual influences on you don't believe that any—any writer has time to go to school to any one man.
He learn—learns from everything he reads.
He steals from any source that's available.
He has no morals whatever.
But he—I don't think he ever sets out to say "Now I'm going to write like Joyce" or write like anybody else that he's too busy writing about people.
He remembers everything he reads without having to memorize.
He is—he is voracious and amoral.
He stores away everything telephone directories up and down.
Congressional recorsed to read that.
And the time comes when he needs something and sure enough there it is.
He don't remember where he got it and don't care because he is perfectly willing for anyone after him to take anything from his work at leasm.
I'm quite sure that everythinver read has influenced me.
A. K. Davis Sir do you look at your own work and look at the—and look at the novels of Joseph Conrad which I've heard you expresiking for—do you see any sort of similarities in methodon't.
I've said this before.
That'.
K. Davis I'm sorridn't know ...ne good thing about writing.
When you writook you don't ever have to read it again because you're busy on another one.
Anhink the writer never goes back to see where he got what from.
I'm sure he could find plenty of sources but he—he don't do it because he's busy with another one then.
A. K. Davis We—we discussed Joseph Conrad in the course thaeach.
We frequently come up against you and vice versa and—anas—I was curious to know whether you—you saw any similarities imagine ient back over the worould find similaritiesan find similarities between Conrad and Hardy.
And I'm suran find Conrad in my stuff and find almost anybody else you could name.
A. K. Davias thinking of the particular thing of Conrad's effort to surround an event by throwing light on it from past—past and future as well as present.
He—he—he seems to—seems to stop aarticular event and—and throw light from this character and that character and from—from the front and the rear and the side iay thaon't remember other novelists doing before his time.
I'm inclined to think that all writers do that only most of them except Conrad and me may bittle more clever about it.
Probably Conrad was because he deliberately taught himseloreign language to write in.
And mine may be becausever—never went to school enough to save myself the shortcuts of learning English.
That we both arittle more obvious than the others for that reason.Sir some months ago you expresseear in the loss of frontiers in American writing.
Do you see any new frontiers opening upell not exactlrontierhink now that we are faced with more of a—ohreat.
It could hardly brontier to be conquered.
It's—it'orce to be resisted the force that is the pressure to make everybody belong tass oroup which in my opinion would be the death of the writing and the painting and the music and everything else that man has got to resist that.
It's difficult to resist because tertain extent he has got to compromise now simply in order to get along.
It's the—you've got to—to be on the alert constantly to know just exactly where to draw the line which is—is too bad for the artist who should have all his time free to—to fight simpler dragons than that.
Fredson Bowers Do you find as your own work comes nearer to the future that you yourself alter in any respect in relation to ito that would belong to the same belief that it—I have never quite done it yet that it fails in all respects.
That it hasn't—hasn't shown the future.
It hasn't beeood enough picture of the past.
It's not a—a good enough picture of—of now "is" to please me.
Fredson Boweras thinking of—of—as—as the setting and the time element in this series comes nearer to the present day whether as you get nearer to the modern scene you feel any difference.
Rather than going back to 1909.an't say becausaven't quite got up to 1957 yet.
It's—that's an interesting thought and I'll be curious to know io begin to run into trouble then.
So faaven't got up to that yet.
Edgar Shannon Well then on that score do you feel that though you write ... personally ... that maybe it would be better ... though you write abouast time you are inevitably influenced by the circumstances of the immediate time and reflect some of the concerns of that timeh yes yes.
Anna Barringenow you admire Wolfe tremendously but don't you feel that as Wolfe caught up to the present that he lost something that he had when he haittle more time between him and the—and the event to digestow that comes back to a—a more or less idle remarade years agoave no particular great admiration for Wolfe.
This is what happened in that.
It was aroup years ago.
Somebody asked whahought about my contemporariesaid "We're not done writing yeouldn't say."
And he said "Well haven't you got any opinion at all about them said "About whoe named Wolfe Dos Passos Erskine Caldwell Hemingway and meaid "Welill—I would rate us this way" whicid and that's what that came from and for about twenty years now I've been trying to explain that.
Anna Barringer Welidn't hear it.
But actually don't you think that—that Wolfe was obvious anondered if you felt at all the same way that when he haittle time between him and his childhood to digest what had happened it felt like it sort of seemed cooked and came out different.
It was much better than when he was writing about something that happened abouear analf before.on't know becausaven't read much of Wolfeave just glanced—glanced into ithink I've read one of his short stories but none of the books havver finishedave opened them and reaittle here anittle there buever have finished one so I—I just don't know.Do you think that question goeittle—I'm—I'm interested in—in this question whicome across in Henry James for example that an author has a—a given—has something to write—you get an idea such as you mentionehile ago in connection to Intruder in the Dust.
Which—and I—I ask you for yourself becaushink it will havearing on the question in general—which is better for you to havreat mass of facts and details which are facts and belong tuman situation and all you got to do is work them up and give them order or would you rather just have the essential things the germ of the idea so that you can build in all the other things with the imagination would rather have as few facts as possible because I—in my opinion the writer is writing about truth and—anhink truth and facts have almost no relation to one another.
They ain't very closely connected.
Anould rather have as few facts as possible and let observation and experience and imagination do the rest of it.And wouldn't that then be iay an answer to Miss Barringer's question that if you are remote froime it has less hold on you that it constricts your imagination less than that which is jusear or two ago.on't know if you as immune to facts am it don't matter.
in view of the fact that those people asked you for ratings when the—when the horse race had gotten maybe to the first quarter mark and we're now perhaps halfway around the course would you feel inclined to make any revision in the order that you saw at that timeo becausade my estimate on the—the gallantry of the failure not on the—on the—on the success or the—or the validity of—of the work.
It's on the gallantry of the effort which failed.
In my opinion my work has all failed.
It—it ain't quite good enough which is the only reason to write another one because writing really ain't any funean the mechanics of putting the stuff down on paper is no funan think of too many other things I'd rather do.
And I—I don't see any reason to change that no.
After we have all written out and if there's time to—to look back at it theould—could makrivate estimate of the work.
But right nohink it's too soon.
Of course Wolfe is—is finished because he's dead but the others are not.
Caldwell seems to have written himself out years ago which has nothing to do with the value of—of—of the first books anhink that—that the first books God's Little Acre and the short stories that's enough for any man.
He should be content with that but—but knowing writernow he's not just as I'm not content with mineeant only that Hemingway had sense enough to finethod which he could control and didn't need or—or didn't have to wasn't driven by his private demon to waste himself in trying to do—do more than that.
So he has done consistently probably the most solid work of all of us.
But it wasn't the—the—the splendid magnificent bust that Wolfe made in trying to put the whole history of the human heart on the head oin you might say.
A. K. Davis You've almost answered this but I'll ask you anyway.
Do you think you'll ever write an historical novel set—dealing with the last century?
Would it interest you to do soo becauson't have much patience with facts and any writer is—iongenital liar to begin with or he wouldn't take up writing and souldn't tell the truth even about history.
That's why I'll never writiographyouldn't tell the truth about  I'm sure about it ... .
Any writer tries to improve on what he sees.
In his opinion the Lord ain't near as good as he is at creating people.
you said that Hemingway developeethod he could control.
What do you think—what is your personal opinion of Across the River and into the Trees would say it was—that he considered it a—a bad book.
Just like he considers To Have and Have Noad book probably.
But then the man that—that wrote some of the stories in Men Without Women and some of the early books—he can afford to writad book whenever he wants think.
Miss Hale will agree with that won't you?
Nancy Hale Oh yes.Do you still read any of the books that come out today like the books by Herman Wouk and writers like himon'think that most writers as they get old read less and less.
The books thaead now are the oneead and liked wheas twenty-one years oldaven't reaew book unless it was specifically put in my hand in oh fifteen years.
There have been exceptions of course thaave read for some particular reason like that—that someone asked me to look at it oicked it up by chance and reaage and founiked it ... buon't keep up with modern books anymore.
Wheas younead everything but not anymore.
A. K. Davis What were the books that you read at twenty-one that you—you set store by?
Can you mentioew of themll of Balzac Don Quixote Madame Bovary Salammbo The Temptation of Saint Anthony Turgenev—I wonder what became of him.
He's not even writing any more.
Is he dead?
Does anybody know?
A. K. Davis He must be dead—  Dostoevsky Tolstoy most of Dickens the Old Testament Shakespeare—I don't read as much poetry aid once.
Some of Conrad.
I—I reckon there's maybe fifty books that—that every five yearill read through again some for the story some foharacter.
One of my favorite people iampet her out every winter and read about her again.
A. K. Davis Which one of Conrad do—do you readhe Nigger of the Narcissus.
A. K. Davis Do you read Nostromoaven't read that in years.
A. K. Davis Victoryot in years.
"Falk."
"The End of the Tether."
What's the one about the young man that was given command of the—Lord Jim.
—barque in—?
A. K. Davis DesertedBangkok?
"Youth."
A. K. Davis "Youth" yes.
"Youth."
there'uestion that you may have—it may have been asked of youaven't been to all of the meetings and if you have answered it already you can just ignore it.
Buuestion that always comes up in the classroom in teaching an author who writes both short stories and novels as to what—what if any is the essential distinction in the—in the mind of the author say when he writes the story whether it is to bhort story—is it merelatter of the—of the quantity of materials or is iatter of the purpose which he wishes to produce the effect or is it simplombination of various thingst'uestion of the writer's confidencehink that—that what every writer wanted to be ioet.
He failed and so the next is the short story.
He failed and so all that remains is to—is to write the novel.
The poet can take the—the instance the—the single instant of man's anguish into four lines or fourteen lines.
The short story writer can't do that but he can do it ihousand words.
The novelist can't do either and it takes hiundred thousand words to do.Sir you—you seemed from that to placremium on conciseness yet your most brilliant successes seem to have been in the other direction.
Conciseness is the wrong word.
It's a—it's a—a distillation.
Down to the—to the—the—to perfection.
You've got to use the clumsy language to communicate.
It'istillation of—of the anguish to its essence which the poet can do.
The short story writer is not that good.
He has got to takittle more spacittle more of the clumsy mean tools of communication.
The novelist has got to take still more.
But any story can be told in one sentence.
If it can't be told in one sentence you'd better throw it away and think of one that can be.
Of course the ramifications devolve from that—out of that but the story itself the moment of anguish or triumph can be distilled into one sentence and the poet does it in—in the—the most moving and most memorable way.
He has touched it with—with a—a magic as though that anguish or that triumph had never occurred before.
Edgar Shannon You were saying that you sometimes read something that you wouldn't ordinarily because somebody asked you to or puts it in your hands.
Are you besieged with aspiring writers who wish an opinion oanuscript or something of that sortes.
Nobody can escape that of course.
Buhink any writer that—that brings yoanuscript to read you can save time by not reading that one because the ones that write the good ones haven't got time to bring it to you and say "Read this."
They don't care whether you read it or not or whether you like it or not.
They're the good ones.
A. K. Davis I'm not quite sure how long this meeting is supposed to last.
We've had an hour.
Could you beaew more questions if there are questionses sir.
Yes sir.
Yes indeed.
A. K. Davis Any of you?
The rest of you?
Questions you'd like to askome of the books—You've done—you've done well ... to hush up these people.
They're so full of information.
They don't need anything from me.
A. K. Davis I—I will say this sir.
You speak of Don Quixote as well as your—as one of your—one of the great books one of the books that you most admire.
It'ight long book isn't it hadn't noticed it.
Just like The Nigger of the Narcissus is very shortrobably hadn't noticed that much either.Well you have mentioned some of the—the novels that you like most.
Is there any particular poetry that you think came closest to saying the truth iew wordslmost all of it.
Burns Keats Wordsworth now and then Whitman Ben Johnson Marlowe—almost all of it.
Laforgue.
Goethe.
Almost all of it.
That's why people still read it why the names are still known.Which do you suppose is—is the most difficult the most unattainable for an ambitious youngster who wants to write but doesn't know yet whether he ioet oovelist or what?ather—I may be wrong—from what you say that—that in general you think that—that poetry is—is perhaps the most difficult thing to achieve real intentions.
Well few are good ones.
I—I don't think that difficulty is the word.
It's—it'ombination of—of—oemon and—and—anire that you have.
Difficult or ease has nothing to do with it.
I—I—I wisid know exactly what it is that it takes to makoethink that any writer is—is better off if he looks on himself aoet.
He'ailed poetgree with you.
But to look on himself primarily aoet.
That he has—has found man's history in its—its mutations in the—the—the instances in which it—it becomes apparent his anguish his triumph his—his failures the whole passion of—of breathing is so strong and so urgent that it—it must be recorded.
And if he is very fortunate he can—can do it as the poets did it and if he'ittle less fortunate he can do it as the short story writers do it as Chekhov did it.
If he is least fortunate he's got to go back to the clumsy method of—of Mark Twain and Dreiser.
A. K. Davis Well if there are no further questions we're very much obliged to you indeed  .Yes we are.
Well thank you.
..hink that nobody can say "I'm going to use stream-of-consciousness as my method for writing."
That's—that's wrong.
He'd get into trouble.
He must use that simply aool only when nothing else will do the work.
It's much better to show the character in familiar terms of—of action of speech but sometimes that's not sufficient.
Then you have to use another tool just as at times the carpenter realizes that his familiar tool is not quite enough to do what he wants to do so he's got to stop and make something makool to useYes ma'am.The New York Times spoke of your brooding concern for people.
This—were you born with that brooding concern for the human being or was that—thaision—adulthood approaches or when did this brooding concern  happenohink that'uestion you should ask the man who wrote the piece in the New York Times.
audience laughteon't thinave any brooding concerns for peopleike people.
There's no brooding concern about it.You don't—you don't feel that you havrooding concern didn't knoad until this man told me  buhink people are—are something that one doesn't need to brood about.
People are interesting.
They are the—the most interesting diverting thing on earth.
It's—it's fun to—to watch people and wonder why they do what they do not to brood over them.
Of course one has got to be concerned over man's condition because if—if man is to advance he must take cognizance of man's condition to improve it but you don't brood over it.
You do something about it.
When you see injustice you raise your voice and—and state that "This is—this is baon't like it" but you don't brood over it.
Yes sir.Sir why is it that most of your short stories and hunting stories are so clear and simple like the one you just read yet—yet some of your novels that you think are your finest are you know have to be so mixed up psychologically in that they're hard for the average reader to—to understandell that is something like the first question we had.
The story commands its own method of telling it.
Some stories can be told quite simply and objectively like this little boy's reactions to the adult world that he had to cope with.
Other stories demand more probing into what makes men and women tick.
That is this little boy could show—could show what made him tick by his simple speech and actions.
There are other times when the action and the speech won't show that so the craftsman's got to dig around to find some other method to use to—to show what he hopes to tell.
And it's not that—that the oneike are the ones in which I've done the—in which I'm obscure.
They're the—they're the ones that have caused me the most troublehink none of the books that any writer does are quite good enough.
That's why he writes another one.
The ones that he labors the hardest over or worries the most about he develops this—the same affection for that the parent does for the—for the unfortunate child the sick child or the—the mentally unbalanced child but they—they all are failures in his opinion because they're not as good.
He don't want to be as good as his—his coevals or even just as good as Shakespeare.
He wants to be better than Shakespeare and Homer.
He knows he can't but that's—that's what he works for.
That's what makes a—a writer's life sucappy one.
He always has something to get up tomorrow that he's anxious to do which is to—to attain the impossible never to—to reach satiety always to have somethinittle beyond his reach but still to jump at it to try for it.as speaking to somebody and they mentioned the fact that one of the Adams oon't know who aoung boy of nine seemed to have the future weight of the world on his shoulder—shoulders.
Aoung child did you show this great genius or future genius?
Did you write or did your mother and father know that you were going to breat writer some day?
What indications were there that you were—?
Weluspect that—that to any mother the child ienius no matter what he does anuspect  that to any fatheoy that—that showed no inclination to be anything buramp is—is not much of anything to him and never will be buhink that probably the writer is—is beinriter from the time he begins to observe long before he learns to spell.
It's—sometimean or woman begins to write at an early age.
Sometimes they wait until middle age or even late in life.Well did you write very earlyes but not seriouslyever thought of taking up writing as a—a serious trade until I—I met  Sherwood Anderson in New Orleans aniked him at once.
We would meet in the afternoonad a—had other jobs then buould be off at times and we would walk down in New Orleans and he would talk anould listen.
We would meet in the evening and go to a—a courtyard and—and he would talk anould listen until twelve or one o'clock oveottle of whiskey.
The next morning he would be in seclusion workingouldn't see him until afternoon and then we would walk anould listen and he would talk and we would talk and laugh again in the evening and the next morning he'd still be writing.
Anhought that if that's the sort of life beinriter was then that's the life for me  thaould becomriter.
And started writinook and after the first page or twound it was fun anas at it every day anadn't seen  Anderson in three or four weeks anenderson on the street one day.
She said "We haven't seen you iong time.
What's wrong?
Are you mad at us said "No ma'am I'm writinook."
And she said "Good Lord."
audience laughteaw her later and she said "I told Sherwood you were writinook.
He said 'Do you want him to read it?
'adn't thought of anybody reading itaid "Well'm if he wants to he can."
She said "Well he told me he would makrade with you.
If he don't have to read that manuscript he'll tell his publisher to take it.aid "Done."
And so he told his publisher to take it.
That's hoecame a—a writer.Which book was that That was one called Soldier's Pay the first one.
That was back in 192elieve.
to what extent carofessional writer call his own shots?
Do you feel that the publisher senses what your public expects you to write and puts the pressure on you to writertain wayn my case there's never been any pressure.
Never—never been any pressure at allave written manuscripts which—which before they were—were donyself decided were not good enough anurned them up.
There have been other manuscripts whicould send to the publisher and he'd say foertain reason "We can't print this" sould keep it until times changed and then he'd say "We can print them now or something like that" but there're never been any pressure on me.
I—I've either had the best publishers or maybe some providence watched over me and kept me from—from getting into trouble but there's never been any pressure on me anhink that is—is what makes the—the fiction writer the poet's life the best one because he is his own man or woman.
Nobody tells him what to do or say.
If you'rramatist then you've got to compromise with actors and directors and with the public or whoever's puts up the money for it.
But the writer is probably the only person alive who can be completely individual to—to do exactly as he wants to doYes sir.I saw something not long ago that took The Sound and the Fury in the four sections and tried to draarallel between the id and ego and super-ego and the author aerson.
Don't you think that is indicative of whaot of critics and scholars are doing with not only you but with contemporary writers making psychological inferences and finding symbols that the author never intendedelould say that the author didn't deliberately intend buhink that—that in the same culture the background of—of—of the critic and of the writer are so similar thaart of—of each one's history is the—the seed which can be translated into the symbols which are standardized within that culture.
That is the writer don't have to know Freud to have—have written things which anyone who does know Freud can divine and reduce into—to symbols.
And so when the critic finds those symbols they are of course there.
But they were there as—as—as inevitably as the critic should—should stumble on his own knowledge of Freud to discern the symbol.
Buhink the writer is primarily concerned in telling about people in the only terms he knows which is out of his experience his observation and his imagination.
And the experience and the imagination and the observation oulture are—are all the people in that culture partake of it of the same three things more or less.
The—the critic has a—a valid part in any culturehink that it's—it might bood thing if most writers were like me and didn't bother to read him.
That is the writer knows what is in his book and he knows whether it—it failed or didn't fail.
The—and so it's possible that—that reading the criticisms could doung writer harm because it could confuse him.
It could be—get him to think in terms of the symbolism which the critic who is usuallood deal more erudite than the writer can find in his work.
what was your reaction to the Greek production of Requiem foun didn't get to see it.
It was a—a gala night and there was so much running back and forth.
That was the—the day that—that Makarios was freed by the British which was the first day that the British Ambassador could come out on the streets of Athens at night and so there waood deal oelebration so much of being hauled around from one ambassadorial box to another then having to go backstage and—and sidn't gehance to see the playust saw scraps and fragments of it.
audience laughteYes ma'am.How do pronounce that county of yours correctly?
...
If you break it down into syllables it's—it's not too difficult.
YAK-NA-PA-TAW-PHA Yoknapatawpha.
It'hickasaw word meaning water runs slow through the flatland.Means whatater flows through slow through the flatland.
in line with the question about the sometimes incomprehensibility of the novels to the average readeill confess it tooittle more than three years to read The Sound and the Fury not only because at firsound it difficult to understand but because later aid begin to understand iound it very strong stuff really stronger thaould—could take all at once anondered how long it took you to write this.
It didn't take too long to write it.
It started out ahort story and then grew.
The—the obscurity iriter's work is the—is the writer's fault.
It comes froali—very valid reason to him.
It's the sense the foreknowledge of death which everyone has.
The writer has—has been stricken with the—the passion and beauty of life the world and a—a demon-driven need to—to express that to put it down on paper or cut it into marble or into music and with that foreknowledge that he has onlimited time to do it he may be dead tomorrow—he's got to do it all while he can still breathe and it's a—a desireed to put the whole history of the human heart into any and every word every paragraph that he writes and the obscurity comes froelief whicold that—that there is no such thing as "was."
That is that every man at any moment in any action of his life is the sum of his whole past and to—to show that man iook or story intact and whole all the long thread of his past has got to be implied or inferred or suggested anaven't yet found any simple method to do that.
The obscurity is not deliberateate that obscurity as much as any reader buaven't found a—a better way yet to do it.I bet it waewarding experience to keep at itondered too as I've noticed evidences of—of characters of—in various works of yours of mental instability of one kind or another.
For instance the idiot in The Sound and the Fury and theemember a—a—an old woman who kept the body of her murdered lover for years and years and ... maybe that was one of your short stories.
Yes.I wondered whether this comes from study of mental instability or observation or is it imagination.
For instance an idiot?
How can people know how these mental processes workne can't of course.
That to the writer iart of the—the tragic yet immortal human condition.
Of course there're not as many idiots in Mississippi as in my—my books probably  but—but there are some and—and since there are some that iacerity in the—the tragic and—and beautiful human condition though the—the—the novelist is not trying to—to preach or deliveessage.
He—he is showing to anyone that will take the trouble to read that—that there is pity there is injustice there are things in man's condition which should be changed should be rectified and if not that should be—be looked on with pity and compassion which is—which iart of beauty too the capacity to—for compassion for pity is—is to me just as splendid as the capacity to be brave heroic.
And the—the—the capacity the—the failure which—which is baseness and sin are—are—are just as—have just as much need for compassion as the—the—the mentality which is bad that if one is to—to change man's condition must—one must believe in—in the verities of—of not only baseness but—and bravery but of compassion too never to judge.Does it give the author as much pain as it does the reader to produce scenes such as when Caddy wanted to see her baby and Jason just drove byes it does but that's—the—the writer is not simply dragging that in to—to—to pulew tears he is—he puts that down as an instance of man's injustice to man.
That man will always be unjust to man yet there must always be—be people men and women who are capable of the compassion toward that injustice and the hatred of that injustice and the will to risk public opprobrium to stand up and say "This is rotten this stinkon't have it.
"Do you think anyone really wants to be pitied thougho nobody does.
Because nobody believe that he deserves pity.
how do you feel about the Negro in the Southbout what?
About the Negro in the Southell that's a—that'ig question.
Could you bittle specific?
Well no.
The Negro is—iart of our economy and our—our southern traditions.
It's true anywhere Virginia Mississippi or Texas.
The—the—the southern—southern—the white southerner loves Negroes as individual Negroes and—but he—he don't like Negroes in the mass as apart from the northerner who in theory loves the Negroes in the mass but he's terrified and frightened of individual Negroes.
audience laughtehink that is a—the—the condition of the Negro in the South has got to be changed for the simple reason two simple reasons.
One is that he's—there's seventeen million of him now.
He is diffuse over the country to where he can bolitical factor anywhere.
And also if we are to cope with—with a—a culture which says that man is—is of no importance as measured and matched against the state if we're to cope with that and be successful we ourselves have got to havulture in which any man is of infinite importance much more important than the state and we can't have seventeen million second class citizens iulture like that and have anybody believe it.
But it'low process.
It will takreat deal of patience and—and good sense.
But it must be doneYes sir.Do you believe that integration as defined by the Supreme Court will come to Mississippi at any time in the near future or futuret won't come into Mississippi or anywhere else because of any decision of any court.
That's something that has got to be settled by people.
But the—yes I—I think that—that whether—integration may possibly never come in—in the sense that people think of ihink that—that equality for the Negro will comehink if the Negro has political equality to vote if he has economic equality if he has educational equality then he won't want to mix with white folks any more than white folks wanted to mix him becausan't imagine any Negro after the—his experience with white folks wanting to be that close to them.
But he has—he will get equality.
If it's given to him bupreme Court ukase and enforced with police as soon as the police are gone then some smart white man or even smart Negro will take his equality away from him again.
He has got to be taught the responsibility of equality.
That the—that the Constitution never said everybody is to have happiness.
They want to have—have the right to gain happiness if they could and—and happiness or freedom is something that you've got to work for.
If it—if it were not to be worked for it wouldn't be worth having.
It's got to be worked for and defended.
Who was the Irish Member of Parliament who said "Man—God hath vouchsafed man liberty only under condition of eternal vigilance which condition if he break it servitude is the consequence of his crime the punishment of his guilt"?
Well that's true of anyone.
You can't have freedom unless you deserve it and work to keep it.
That's—and equality of course is freedom.
which book do you consider to be your greatest bookone of them are good enough for me.
They all failed.
The one that—that I'm—I love the best is the one that made the most splendid failure which is The Sound and the Fury.
That's the onorked at the hardest but none of them are good enough which is whrote another one this year and I'll write another one next year anave every intention of living to be abouundred years old still trying to writook ....  Of courson't but I'll still try.
you've written for both TV and motion picturesondered which medium you would prefer to work with didn't work for either one seriously because that is not my bent for the reasotated that in either one it iatter of compromisompromise with—with the actor with the director and mainly with the people that put up the money.
It's—it's so expensivV show ooving picture show.
I've hareat deal of—of fun working for moving pictures becausiked the peoplorked with buever took working for any of them seriously.
It was jusleasant way to geheck every Saturday night to me.
audience laughteYes ma'am.I would like to know what you think of Ernest Hemingway ariter what is your opinion of hime ian who has—has never betrayed the—his integrity which—which one accepts to briter.
He learned early in life a—a method by which he could do his work.
He has never varied from that method.
It—it suited him.
He handled it well.
If his work continues then it's going to get better.
His last boohink The Old Man and the Sea was—was the best because he discovered something which he had never found before which was God.
Up to that time his people functioned iacuum they had no past but suddenly in The Old Man and the Sea he found God.
There was the—the big fish—God made the big fish that had to be caught.
God made the—the old man that had to catch the big fish.
God made the shark that had to eat the fish and God loved all of them.
And if his work goes on from that then it will—will still be better which is something that—that not all writers can say.
They—too many tragically write themselves out too young and then their lives are unhappy.
That happened with Fitzgerald happened with Sherwood Anderson and so they—they go to pieces.
can you keep up with the younger generation the ... and all the younger people and what the young people are doing?
Or is that too importantot actuallyhink that—that all writers or maybe all people as they get older they read less and less.
The bookead now are the books thaead and loved wheas twenty-one years old.
Unless someone puts the book in my hand and says "Read this."
Theead it.
Son't—I'm not too familiar with—with the work of—of the young writer nowadays.
Young writers come to see me and talk to me and snow more young writers thanow their work.
Yes sir.ondered what's your opinion of John Steinbeck nowteinbeck to me has probably not done his best work.
So far he'etter reporter than he is a—a novelist.
Anhink maybe his—his best work is still to come.Sir what are some of your favorite bookson Quixote some of Conrad Heart of Darkness The Nigger of the Narcissus most of Dickens The Brothers Karamazov Anna Karenina Madame Bovary the Old Testamentupposave about fifty thaead—I go in and out like you go intoom to meet old friendspen the book in the middle and read foittle while anmagine over the course of every ten yearould have read all of them throughYes sir.Are these books then indicative of the authors who have written them and people who have had the most influence on you ariter think that—that any writer is influenced by every word he ever read in his life from the telephone book up and down  that he himself cannot say what book influenced him at what time.
It may be if he went back over his work he could pick out pages scenes and could see the derivation but he never has time to do that because by that time he's busy writing another book.
Actually as I've said—said before one virtue in beinriter is that every time you finisook that's one book you'll never have to read.
You're finished with that one.
But I'm sure that any writer is influenced by everything that he has read by everything he has seen.
He is completely amoral.
He will take what he needs from any source but then he is willing to reciprocate that anyone after him can take what they find in his work that they can use  but he'll have no compunction about stealing right and left.
Not deliberately but he's—it's his storehouse and when he needs it he uses it.This pertains then to both ideas and techniques of writingell ideas in the sense of learning how people behavehink that—that he doesn't bother about taking the abstract ideas of other writers because unless that abstract idea fits some character which he himself feels that he's invented then he will take it but—but the fiction writer is not too interested in ideas any more than he's very interested in facts.
That he's interested in people and—and in man and his—the infinite variety of his mutations and his struggles and comical errors and tragic mistakes and his successes his hopes.
Not in his ideas but in his eternal conflict with himself with his fellows or with his environment.
That's what the—the fiction writer's writing about.
It takehilosopher to write about ideas and most writers have been so busy scribbling from childhood that they never had time to get much schooling to know much about ideasYes ma'am.Sherwood Anderson and T.S.
Eliot seem to feel that there has been no classic since Virgil's Aeneid anonder to what extent you have grown up in philosophy or ideas.
Well I'm sure iver read Virgil—I can't remember whetheid or not—I've stolen from him too  for the reason that the writer is influenced by everything he ever—ever read.
Buon't think that as long as the writer is—is busy writing he's got time to make any didactic statements about where culture stopped and where it didn't stop.
That he's not really interested in culture or even interested in literature until he writes himself out and he has been corrupted by—by books so much that he has nothing else to do with his time save to take up beiniterary man.
Most writers are not literary men.
They're really—they're craftsmen.Then you believe that  Eliot underestimates his culture apparentlyo no.
That he's perfectly—I'm perfectly willing for him to have his opinions but to min't interested in it.
audience laughteYes ma'am.You sairiter knows when he succeeds or fails anather you don't use the critics' opinions auide.
What gives you the sense of having failed or succeeded iookhat would probably be the worst day the writer ever—ever faces because then nothing remains but to cut his throathink that he would —the only way to express it is—is what Hemingway means by saying "to feel good."
He finishes the—the job and—and there's nothing that is still dangling nothing more he wants to do to it.
It's finished.
It's complete.
As long as it's failed there's always something you think now iould just go back and do this oveould do it better.
But you know that'aste of time.
The best thing is to takew story.
...gap in tape all the horror and difficulty pessimism—a lot of pessimism in the world today.
Do you sort of takim view of the human race surviving or do you think we'll go on forever and ever and evero noon't think that anything scientists can cook up iaboratory is going to do away with man.
That when this—... completing your writing whether you start writing it or does it develop as you got usually develops ao.
It can begin with an anecdote or—or an action oharacter.
Then when enough people get in it to begin to talk back and forth to each other and to impact on one another and to begin to quarrel with one another they take charge of the story.
Alave to do then is to trot along behind witotebook anencil and put down what they do or say.
Then of course at the end you have to go back to the rules of unity and coherence and emphasis and give it some sort of shape but—but the characters take—take charge of the story.
That's my own system.
Other people work from plots and diagrams and keep notesever haotebook and never did any research.
Mine is done for pleasure for fun.Will—wilansion follows the same characters as The Townes that's right.Do you see it?
You're working on it nowes.
do you believe that there imerican language developing as compared to the English language or that they are the same languagees'hink soon't know how many generations eons before it will be too distinct but any language if it is not changing will not last long.
That is the only alternative to change and progress is—is death.
It may be with the—with the world being condensed by rapid transportation there'll be even less divergence of the two languages than ever buould say that—that there will be—bhange and in time there will be just as much difference between the English English and American English as—as there is between classic Greek and modern Greek unless both have been abolished in the meantime and there's still another language that comprises both which will also be itate of flux and change and advancement.
do you think that an author is actually getting into hot water if he doesn't stick to subjects that he himself has experiencedo no the imagination will serve.
You stick to experience and observation—are only shortcuts but imagination will—will well serve.
It's—it has served so many writers when they need—I think right now—all the—these books of so-called science fictiohink of H.G.
Wells' Time Machine that there's absolutely no limit to what man can imagine and he—and by—by usinew simple mechanical facts he can make it credible.
That is nobody can dispute him if what he—he says holds together assuming you grant his premise.
Thank yoery much.
Thank you.
... make the statements which—which we will follow which the rest of the South must followas a—a little ashamed for all of us when your government issued those invitations and then had to retract some of them the sort of thing that you'd expect Mississippi to do but Mississippi don't expect Virginia to.
... experiences here that—thaill—aftead left Virginia and have thought about iill realize more and more how—how pleasant it was the contact with the people the young people that have come into my office with their carefully rehearsed literary questions  and once we get past them we just talk and that's interesting.
They—they tell me what they want to do and what they think about the condition what we should do about it.
Almost every day one comes in and once we get past the stiffness of that first question which—which they have rehearsed because they're seeing me then you get down to—tuman being as someone said the .... That's—that's betterent out to Albemarle School one morning and it—it tooittle thawing but aftehile it became quite well.
By the end of it there waoung man trying to sell me some cattle.
Another man wanted to swap horses with me.
Yes ma'am.Welon't mean this to barefully rehearsed literary question buid notice in the paper where you mentioned that the Old Testament was among your old literary friends or one of the ones that you like to browse in and re-read—  Yes.Anealize it ilassic buas wondering why the New Testament did not have as much to offer?
Is it because it is so narrative or some of it isn't usefulo me the New Testament is full of ideas anon't know much about ideas.
The Old Testament is full of people perfectly ordinary normal heroes and blackguards just like everybody else nowadays and I—I like to read the Old Testament because it's full of people not ideas.
It's people all trying to get something for nothing or ...  or to be braver than they are.
Just ordinary everyday folks people—that's whike to read that.
That's apart from the fine poetry of the—of the prose.
Yes ma'am.I do havarefully rehearsed one but I'm really interested in your ... to builicture of this vastly materialistic American society which can't tolerate a—a writer or human beings even.
And yet you seem to indicate that there was some hope to get—for Americans to get beyond this purely materialistic stage and yet in your writing it—it seems that the Snopeses have triumphed anondered if you'd care to comment on that.on't believaid that our culture can't tolerate it.
Whaeant to say there was that so far our culture is not aware that there iorce ... We deal in terms of the human spirit that the day will come when it will have to become aware of it.
So far it doesn't need to and it's not that it objects.
It simply isn't aware yet that that'orce that exists.
About the Snopes the—no fiction writer is interested primarily in messages or warnings but indirectly and by coincidence he does suggest messages and warnings.
The—the—the story of the Snopes is not This is what the South is coming to.
It's—it's simply This is what can happen if we don't watch these people.
That it's all imaginary.
They are underlined for emphasis.
They are exaggerated for emphasis.
But this is what can happen if we don't watch it.
Yes ma'am.Atudent who always had to struggle through literature courses trying to dig out the meanings of things which seemed obvious to other people I'd be curious to know if ariter you sort of do have these messages in mind greater ideas which the English teachers and so forth always produce so readily and some of the students  can't find them anywhere.
No'm not really.
The writer is writing about people.
He has got to use the tools he has which is his own experience his own observation and out of that in the course of—of twenty-one twenty-two years it takes to mature then whatever years after that come the opinions.
He doesn't have to stop and say "Now this is whaelieve."
It's there.
He don't know he's got it.
Then when he writes suddenly something—somebody says something he says "Well yes that's so.
That's whaelieve too."
He didn't put that in the character's mouth.
The character said "This is whahink."
The writer says "Yegree with you."
That he is too busy dealing with people to have time to deliver messages to anyone.
The messages happen just by chance.
That he is interested in—in creating flesh and blood people to do the—the tragic or the comic things which people do for—for pleasure.
That ihink that one should read for pleasure that one doesn't necessarily have to read for pleasure buyself read for pleasure not for ideas.
That if it's—I've got to hunt around iook to—looking for an idea then I'd rather do something else.
I'd rather do something that's more fun than that.
It won't be reading.
Yes ma'am.
although you primarily write about the South and southern people are you striving for universality that people who live in another locality can use ithat's it.
It's to use a—a locale which the writer is most familiar with.
It saves him doing research.
That is if he don't know anything about California or Canada or Australia if he don't dittle research first he'll write something and somebody will say "Hold up here.
That ain't so.
This is the way it is in Australia."
Where if he writes about what he knows nobody is going to bother him that way because he knows what he is putting down.
People are the same but it's the—the differences in their background the milieu they function in which is different not their behavior.
But then of course the milieu the background the environment will—will change the—the terms of the behavior not the act itself and so the writer simply uses the—the background he knows just as the carpenter uses the tools that he has at his hand.
Rather than to go somewhere to borroammer oaw he will use the one he's got so he won't have to fetch one.
Yes ma'am.elieve Somerset Maugham said at one time that he felt it was rathead thing in his own life and assumed it to be in the life of any writer in that he felt that he had to divorce himself from life itself tertain extent in that he was continually observing and thinking in terms of writing down what he saw.
Anhink that possibly he felittle deprived in that he had this demon which caused him to want to do this and that he could not live himself more as ordinary people do and—well in that he was more concerned with recording life as he saw it and living it was more likicarious sense.
Do you feel that that is true of most writers or did you find something else trueell it is not true of—of me anmagine it's not true of—of many other writers.
It would be true of—would be true of—of many other writershink that—that Maugham of an older—older culture had more time to be that objective about his own sub—subjectivity if you can accept that paradoxical statementhink that—that maybe Henry James for instance had the same approach toward his work that Maugham did but Henry James had not got far enough to—to realize that that was depriving him of something that he didn't want to be deprived of.
That is Henry James probably was quite happy to live detached from life to write Henry James.
Yes sir.I hesitate to ask sucroad question sir but what effect do you think McCarthyism has had on freedom of thought and expression in American universities would say that—that McCarthyism that whole thing has haood effect on American universities in that it has—has shown not the—the educated man but has showot of—of uneducated people what that sort of thing can cause that uneducated people havreater belief in the—that—that the thought—the freedom of thought must be inviolable that they never thought about it before and so in that sense McCarthy serveurpose.
It's too bad that that should be one of the curses of democracy too that that purpose can't—must be paid for with the three or four years of McCarthy.
Iay democracy has the capacity to use somehow almost everything.
Yes ma'am.
this—this iuestion about your way of writingas wondering whether you—you constantly go about the writing or whether it just comes out all at once.
Because to reaook of yours it seems to come all at once buust wondered you hear of so many writers who are working over their novels and rewriting parts until they're finished.
That depends anon't think that any writer could havard and fast rule about it.
In my own case I'm lazy.
That ion't like to sit down and—and puundred thousand words on paperate to face the fact that I've got to do itill put that off as long as possible and so in the meantime as much of the revising as possible happens up here.
Then when the demon won't let me alone any longeit down to write anry to—to do it son't have to revise it won't have to do it again.
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes I'll have to re-write and re-write and re-write and re-write.
Sometimes it—it never comes out to suit me.
I'll throw it away.
But occasionally I'm lucky and the first time's enough.
But no writer can know beforehand whether he'll have to do it once oozen times but he has got to please himself and he will—he will curse it.
He will curse his fate that he ever got into sucacket but he will keep on until it's the best he can do with it.
There waoung lady back there that—I was just wondering if you thought that some sort of form of government subsidy ... some of the European writers ... don't thineard that too well.
If you will tell me again ma'am?
Do you think that artists in this country would benefit from some form of government subsidization that is like like the author programs Italy has or I don't think that an artist should be subsidized too much by anyonehink that—that he has got to be free and eveittle hardship may be good for him.
That—I'm assuming that most artists are like me and—and they are lazy and if they had too much money they would do that much less work.
That if they ain't got much money just enough to buittle tobacco and occasionallrink and—and something to eat that they might worittle more.
If it was too easy for them they would put off the work.
That—now that's different from the opera because opera theater requires so much more money than the cost oeam of paper and—and three or four pencils so theater has got to be subsidized and—and if—if private capital is ever obliterated then there will have to be subsidy to print the books but the—the artist himself shouldn't be subsidized too much.
He would bittle better off if he had to hold another job and—and wrote in his spare time because that would keep his—his work on the plane of the amateur which it should be.
That when he begins to think of himself arofessional writer he is sunk.
He's got to do it because it's fun.
It's got to bobby.
Yes sir.Sir I'm going to put you on the spot with this.
You say thariter must write truth and he must—therefore he must search for truth.
If Arthur Miller is found guilty of contempt on the grounds that as he claims moral—his own moral character which kept him from revealing the names of other writers in his cell that he once visited would you publicly come out in favor of his positionure.
Yes if—if there—there's something you believe is—is wrong to do then don't do it no matter who else disagrees with you.
That would have nothing to do with—what whether he writes from now on whether he's in contempt of—of court or not.
Whether he is sent to jail or not would have nothing to do with what he writes.
Yes if you believe that something is wrong to do don't do it.Are there any other questions?
Wele want you to know how glad we are that your demon let you come over here tonight and be with us and we'll all remember this aighlight of this year and probablong time to come.
Thank you ma'am.
... has consented to come and talk to us about "The Old Man."
We've been talking about "The Old Man" for the last week and been discussing it—its structure and its meaning and its techniques—in isolation unconnected with the work with which it was originally published in alternating chapters The Wild Palms.
Our questions till be completely unrehearsed and unscreened according to your desire anhink this is the first time that you've talked treshman class and so it will be interesting to observe what emergesas consented to begin the meeting by reading the end of "The Old Man.
"That was all the convict told them.
They left the sawmill fast he had no time to buy food until they reached the next—next landing.
There he spent the whole sixteen dollars he had earned and they went on.
The River was lower now there was no doubt of it and sixteen dollars' worth looked likot of food and he thought maybe it would do would be enough.
But maybe there was more current in the River still than it looked like.
But this time it was Mississippi it was cotton; the plow handles felt right to his palms again the strain and squat of the thick buttocks against the middle buster's blade was what he knew even though they paid buollaay here.
But that did it.
He told it they told him it was Saturday again and paid him and he told about it—nighmoked lantern iisc of worn and barren earth as smooth as silveircle of crouching figures the importunate murmurs and ejaculations the meagre piles of worn bills beneath the crouching knees the dotted cubes clicking and scuttering in the dust; that did it.
"How much did you winhe second convict said.
"Enough" the tall one said.
"How muchEnough" the tall one said.
It was enough exactly; he gave it all to the man who owned the second motor boat (he would not need food now) he and the woman in the launch now and the skiff towing behind it the woman with the baby and the paper-wrapped parcel beneath his peaceful hand on his lap; almost at once he recognised not Vicksburg because he had never seen Vicksburg but the trestle beneath which on his roaring wave of trees and houses and dead animals he had shot accompanied by thunder and lightninonth and three weeks ago; he looked at it once without heat even without interest as the launch went on.
But now he began to watch the bank the levee.
He didn't know how he would know but he knew he would and then it was early afternoon and sure enough the moment came and he said to the launch owner "I reckon this will do."
"Herehe launch owner said.
"This dont look like anywhere to me."
"I reckon this is it" the convict said.
So the launch put inshore the engine ceased it drifted up and lay against the levee and the owner cast the skiff loose.
"You better let me take you on until we come to something" he said.
"That was wharomised."
"I reckon this will do" the convict said.
So they got out and he stood with the grapevine painter in his hand while the launch purred again and drew away already curving; he did not watch it.
He laid the bundle down and made the painter fast tillow root and picked up the bundle and turned.
He said no word he mounted the levee passing the mark the tide-line of the old raging dry now and lined traversed by shallow and empty cracks like foolish and deprecatory senile grins and entereillow clump and removed the overalls and shirt they had given him in New Orleans and dropped them without even looking to see where they fell and opened the parcel and took out the other the known the desired fadeittle stained and worn but clean recognisable and put them on and returned to the skiff and took up the paddle.
The woman was already in it.
The plump convict stood blinking at him.
"So you come back" he said.
"Well well."
Now they all watched the tall convict as he bit the end from the cigar neatly and with complete deliberation and spat it out and licked the bite smooth and damp and tooatch from his pocket and examined the match fooment as though to be sure it waood one worthy of the cigar perhaps and raked it up his thigh with the same deliberation—a motion almost too slow to set fire to it it would seem—and held it until the flame burned clear and free of sulphur then he put it to the cigar.
The plump one watched him blinking rapidly and steadily.
"And they give you ten years more for running.
That's badellow can get used to what they give him at first to start off witont care how much it is eveundred and ninety-nine years.
But ten more years.
Ten years more on top of that.
When you never expected it.
Ten more years to have to do without no society no female companionship—" He blinked steadily at the tall convict.
But he (the tall convict) had thought of that too.
He had haweetheart.
That is he had gone to church singings and picnics with her—a girear or so younger than he short-legged with ripe breasts aneavy mouth and dull eyes like ripe muscadines who owneaking-powder can almost full of ear-rings and brooches and rings bought (or presented at suggestion) from ten-cent stores.
Presently he had divulged his plan to her and there were times later when musing the thought occurred to him that perhaps if it had not been for her he would not actually have attempted it—thiere feeling unworded since he could not have phrased this either that who to know what Capone's uncandled bridehood she might not have dreamed to be her destined fate what fast car filled with authentic colored glass and machine guns running traffic lights.
But that was all past and done when the notion first occurred to him and in the third month of his incarceration she came to see him.
She wore ear-rings anracelet or so which he had never seen before and it never became quite clear how she had got that far from home and she cried violently for the first three minutes though presently (and without his ever knowing either exactly how they had got separated or how she had made the acquaintance) he saw her in animated conversation with one of the guards.
But she kissed him before she left that evening and said she would return the first chance she got clinging to him sweatinittle smelling of scent and soft young female flesh slightly pneumatic.
But she didn't come back though he continued to write to her and seven months later he got an answer.
It waostcarolored lithograph oirmingham hotel withildisnked heavily across one window the heavy writing on the reverse slanted and primer-like too This is where were honnymonning at.
Your friend () Vernon Waldrip  The plump convict stood blinking at the tall one rapidly and steadily.
"Yes sir" he said.
"It's them ten more years that hurt.
Ten more years to do withouoman no womaalellow wants—" He blinked steadily and rapidly watching the tall one.
The other did not move jackknifed backward between the two bunks grave and clean the cigar burning smoothly and richly in his clean steady hand the smoke wreathing upward across his face saturnine humorless and calm.
"Ten more years—" "Women 'blank'!"
the tall convict said.
Yes sir.Was there something that influenced you to write this storyes the storas trying to tell was the story of—of—of Charlotte and Harry Wilbourneecided that it needed a—a contrapuntal quality like music and srote the other story simply to underline the story of Charlotte and Harryrote the—the two stories by alternate chapters.
I'd write the chapter of one and theould write the chapter of the other just as the musician puts in—puts counterpoint behind the theme that he is working with.
Yes sir.Well why don't in this story none of the characters have nameso me the story was simply for background effect and—and they didn't need names.
They just needed to be people in motion doing the exact opposite thing to the tragedy of—of Harry and Charlotte in the other story.
To me they didn't need names—that they were not too important.
Yes sir.Sioticed that you do have some names though in your story.
Some names are mentioned such as Bledsoe the—the convict.
Do you—do you have them in for any reasonell the—the girl that jilted him she had to havame to sign to the postcard.
The other people if—I don't remember the rest of the story becausaven't read it in about thirty years but when they had names it was for that—that reason as simple as that.
At—at the moment they had to havame.
Yes sir.Well in the swamp three of the men who lived in the swamp you gave them the names Tine and Toto and Theule anonder if those names had any type of significance or were supposed to be any type of literary allusion.
They're rather colorful namehink.
Non't think so.
They were—were names you might say indigenous to that almost unhuman class of people which live between the Mississippi River and the levee.
They belong to no state.
They belong to no nation.
They—they are not citizens of anything and sometimes they behave like they don't even belong to the human race.So you have had experiences with these peoplees.
Yeemember oncas going—one of them was going to take me hunting.
He invited me to come and stay with his kinfolks whatever kin they werever did know—a shanty boat in the river anemember the next morning for breakfast we had a—a bought chocolate cake anold possum and corn whiskey.
They had given me the best they hadas company.
They had—had given me the best food they had.
Iay asuestion pursuing this ideaelieve that earlier in your life that you did quitit of traveling and haot of experiences as an apprentice seamaelieve and flying.
Do you think that—to any author or even more generally to anyone who wants to formulate ideas about life and all do you think that this is very valuable while younger to travel around and not be fixed down or—ell it—it don't do you any harm but it's—you don't have to do it.
Homer probably didn't dreat deal of traveling and he did pretty well ariter.
I—that is the—the material you write from has got to bood deal more than just what you can see and remember.
It's—it's got to be observation experience which—and part of experience is what you read—plus imagination.
So the observation—don't hurt you.
You may need it but you can get along without it if you have to with the imagination and experiencehink the best source to learn to briter is from reading what the—the best the giants of—of the past have done.
Yes sir.
did the tall convict in "The Old Man" believe in Gode probably hadn't got around to that yet.
His background would be the—the bucolic provincial Southern Baptist and it may be a—a debatable question whether that sort of Baptist believes in God or not but—  Probably when he got older and got out of the penitentiary if he ever did and he didn't need to expend too much energy trying to have fun any more he might have taken up religion might have been a—a professor of God whether he believed it or not or even know what God was.
But at this time he would—would have said he did and if anyone had told him he didn't he would have fought him but he probably didn't know what God meant.It seems to me in reading the book that he was dependinot on fate to lead his life—that he would be led by fate as much as religion.
Well he depended more on himself that to him fate was—was just his bad luck the sort of thing that shouldn't happen tog.
But he depended on himself that he—he knew what he wanted which was—was to be secure to be back in that penitentiary.
That's where he was secure because he didn't mind hard work.
He didn't know anything else.
And suddenly he was flung out into the world with another woman and all he wanted was to get rid of that woman and get back there where he was safe.
But he didn't depend—he was doing the best he could.
He depended on his own efforts.Well when he got back sir did he share this view with the others that it was ten years without women—I mean do you think he minded thiso no.
He had had enough of women.
After that—that girl had jilted him—she was the one that—that put him there.
It was to geot of money to buy heot more of the Woolworth bracelets and rings.
If it hadn't been for her he wouldn't have been there.
He would have been back at his Mississippi hill home working hard all day long and drinkinittle corn whiskey on Saturday nights and gambling.Yes sir.Sir I'm interested in your saying that.
I'd taken it that he had robbed the train more for the adventure and to be able to say that he had evaded the authorities rather than for the money.
No.
He wanted to please that girl.
He didn't neeot of money.
He was doing all right with his mule his little piece of corn land but suddenly he ran intirl that wanteot of Woolworth rings and so he had to turn robber to get those rings.
Yes sir.Well is this inability or desire not to face women also the kind of thing that the plump convict wound up in this penitentiary—because he didn't want to face the raging woman with whom he had committed this crime?
Did—do you mean this also to be his—his desire not to face life in ... to face reality or the return to the womb?
You mentioned too—you spoke of Christmas as being chained by a—a "clanking umbilical" and we talked about this in this—in my class his jackknife position and the whole idea of escaping from life—do—does the woman here especially the pregnant woman represent life in this senseot to the convict.
That is not consciously.
He—all he wanted to escape from was insecurity.
He—anyone that could be taken over the jumps by the sort of girl that was—that—that got him into undertaking to be a—a bank robber couldn't have been very mature mentally.
That convict was probably still about fifteen or sixteen years old.
And likoy of—of fifteen or sixteen the—the first shock of—of disappointment in love he thinks is going to last forever.
Of course it don't but that's what he thinks and the convict never had grown up yet.Yes sir.Don't you think the seven weeks of ... there the seven years he lost ...ell now that's the sort of thing that if any reader likes to find that in the writer's work he is as far as the writer is concerned perfectly welcome to find it but the writer ain't got time to—to watch all those—all those corners and—and symbols and implications so it's very possible you're right but—but I—I never thought of that before.
Yes sir.Do you think that if the convict had not been given the extra ten years—do you think he would have returned to the security of prison or to the security of his homeell that extra ten years meant nothing to him because he was—was mentally about sixteen or seventeen years old and anything—any sum of time longer than one year is all the same to you when you're fifteen or sixteen years old—that in another year and you'll be an old man anyway and so what's ten years more oundred years to himes sir.Getting back to this security or insecurity do you think that enough background was given of the tall convict before he was in—in the penitentiary before he was sentenced—to—to leave him feel insecure—do you think that he first became insecure when he was in the penitentiary for so lonime being out of it of—of being insecureould that the insecurity came to him withock when that woman betrayed him and he was frightened and he wanted to—to be where no other woman could catch him off balance and take him over the jumps again.
And the place where he was safe from that was in that penitentiary which wasn't so different from the life he would have led if he'd been home.
He would have had to work very hard all day long at home.
He would have had very little for it which was just what he got there but at least behind that barbed wire fence he was safe from another woman that would get him into the—the highwayman business.Do you think he would have stayed on the—the island with the Cajuns if—hadn't they had to leaveo no.
He had to get rid of that woman and the only way he knew to get rid of her was to bring her back to the folks that sent him to get her.
Remember he's—mentally only about fifteen or sixteen years old and by his own lights he's quite honorable and dependable.
They had sent him out witoat to get two people and he did the best he could to get the two people and bring them and the boat back.
Yes sir.Well why—I know that you said that the woman was almost exactly like him—I mean the same type of background and everything and also the woman must have realized that he was trying to get her back but don't you—was the woman also in this immature state that she didn't realize that she could get back more quickly when they were in this armory which is where they had all these other people she was glad to leave with him and when—when she was just about ready to have her child and she—she made aecall no—no cry to the people in this houseboat to let her come aboard.
She was content almost it seems like to just stick with him.
Why is this?ean why didn't she try to better herselfhe didn't know how.
She was as ignorant as he was.
She came from the same class of people that he came from.
She was ignorant.
She was—she was afraid of strangers.
Of course the convict watranger to her too but they had been hurled together bircumstance and it probably didn't take her very long to find out that all that convict wanted was to get her back where he got her from and get rid of her and that's what she wanted too—to get back and find her husband.
She probably hausband.
She may have had other children and she wanted to get back just as bad as he did and since he—he was the man her instinct was to let the man run things.
Yes sir.Did you mean to show any miscarriage of justice by having the additional ten years or rather just to show that although it seemed like injustice that the jail warden was doing exactly what should have been done anyway just because of his knowledge of the people under his carehat additional ten years was—was simply another quantity in—in fate just like the flood that he ran into.
Once he was in it he had to accept the—the extra ten years just as he accepted the flood and worked through it and survived it.
There was no—no more injustice than there was to the flood.
It was just something that was in the—the culture the economy of—of the land he lived in just like that flood was inherent in the—in the geography and the climate and he waan that—that said Well if this is what it is I'll do the besan to tough through it.
That would have been his philosophy.
Yes sir.So when you set out to starovel such as this do you havomplete story in mind or is it jushought that you build upon as you go alongou remember this waounterpoint to the other story.
This to me wasn't too important that these were just the—the—the orchestration of sounds that the musician puts back of the theme of his symphony.
Thaidn't know where this story was going—I just wrote itas as surprised as anybody else to find where it was going but the story thaas trying to tell was the story of—of Charlotte and Harry.And when you reached the point where he met the woman what was your purpose of havinregnant womant—I thought that made it funnier.
To me all this is funny.
audience laughteittle—little more comical to show this man who meant well to—to get involved in—in all sorts of things that would have made a—a weaker or less centered man blench and falter but not him.
It was because he was just stupid and ignorant enough to—to bull right on through this to accept anything the gods threw at him without even knowing that he was being tried.
Yes sir.Well if this is primarily funny ano think that there's humor all through it why do you put the humor in where you do for example the woman—I don't recall the remark—but she's just about ready to have her child and you say something about hold oittle longer.
It's an impossible thing.
And then he's been kicked by a—kicked by the tail of the alligator and she asks him if he's been kicked and he says no that if he'd got hit in the rear end witea shooter.
It would make—there's humor all the way through and then even at the end do you still want the message of—this seeming injustice of society against him to come through or is that secondaryell it's—secondary is not really wrong because it was—the injustice was necessary to make the story funny and so it's not secondary because it was—was quite important to make the story funny.
It's—it'act and if one begins to write about the injustice of society then one has stopped being primarilovelist and has becomolemicist oropagandist.
The fiction writer is not that.
He will use the injustice of society the inhumanity of people as a—as any other tool in telling the story which—which is about people not about the injustice or the inhumanity of people but of people with their aspirations and their struggles and the—the bizarre the—the comic and the tragic conditions they get them in—themselves into simply coping with themselves and one another and environment.
Yes sir.hink you must have pureat deal of time behind choosing the title of "The Old Man.now you took it from the river buonder what else you had in mind.
Possibly does the river symbolize any other things or maybe nature or something elseo.
It's—it's not "The Old Man" it's "Old Man."
That's what the—the Negroes along the river call the river.
They never call it the Mississippi nor the river.
It's just Old Man.
And this had to have some title and so that struck me as beinood title for it.
That refers simply to the river.Did the tall convict have any subconscious attitudes toward the Mississippio he'd never seen it before.
It was jusot of water to him not behaving like any water he ever saw before behave but it was—that was just something that—that you ran into and you had to handle it the best you could.
He never did know where he was and didn't really care.In the book you had elaborated to some extent on the fact that the Old—the Old Man was fruitful and life-giving and such and what it was to farmers and just to the people who lived along the Mississippi and to—to that area.
It—it was fruitful and noestructive force.
Well the destructive quantity had to be accepted too.
That country where this took place was—is alluvial.
It's lower than the river itself.
In the winter it stayed under water from—from the fall rains sometimes as late as June.
That was why they had to build the levees and so in the—the spring and the summer the river is higher than the land.
There'evee and then you look up in the sky and there goeteamboat.
If the levee ever gives way the country will be flooded again.
It's rich because the—the river for—for hundreds of years had deposited the rich silt on top of the ground.
And so the—the river dominates not only the economy of that country but it—it dominates its—its spiritual life.
That the river is—is master of it and any time the Old Man wants to he can—can break the levee and can ruin the cotton crop.
That iay you're—the—the planter is at armistice with him and the superstitious planter believes that he has got to—to make libations make sacrifices to him.
That every so often he's got to let the Old Man come in and take that cotton crop to keep the Old Man iontented frame of mind like the—the ancients with—with the dragon the Minotaur the—the symbols of—of destructiveness which they had to placate sacrifice.
Yes sir.In putting this woman in the boat with the convict did you want to draoint to the lovers in the novel that went along with it or did you just put her in the boat as sort oindrance to progress and No that waefinite parallel.
The—the isolation the solitude of—of the boat in that raging torrent was the—the solitude which Harry and Charlotte had—had tried so long to find where they could be lovers to escape from—from the world.
They went to infinite labor and risk and sacrifice to escape from the world where this convict had been hurled out of the world against his will whether he wanted to or not.
That he and—and the woman he saved had what Charlotte and—and—and Wilbourne had sacrificed everything to get.
That's whaean by counterpoint to the theme of the other book that these two people had what Charlotte and Harry had given up everything—respectability future everything for.
Yes sir.Sir the short fat convict which you placed in the book you call him—you say he's somewhat like something one might find undeog.
Is he there just to emphasize the qualities of the tall convicthat's right.
And to have somebody for the tall convict to—or to—to dig out of the tall convict what had happened.
The tall convict would never have told this himself.
He'd just said he was away fohile and haretty hard time but here he is.
That's all he could have told about what happened to him.
Yes sir.You said that the convict wasn't afraid of work so he returned.
Yet when he was in the swamp with the Cajuns you say that he had forgotten what work was like or something like that.
Do you makistinction between work foeward and then work simply for the sake of something to doe had been so busy trying to keep that boat from being swamped and to get them along from one day to another which was terrific work but to him that wasn't work anymore than somebody falling ofoof that scrabbles at—at shingles and—and chimney pots would consider himself working.
Work to him was—was the—the orderly—the work of—from sunup to sundown and then you rested and then tomorrow you worked again.But he did consider the work at the prison just as much as—  Yes but he had—he had been gone from therong time to him.
That must have seemed like years to him that he had—had been in that boat with that woman who wauisance.
Yes sir.You sort of draw—you dreine somewhere in there between the work at the prison and the work with the—with the alligators because he seemed to work just as hard trapping the alligators because he was going to get part of the profits from the alligators.
That's right.Was there—did—did that makifference in the type of—in the work that he was doing and the way he went about it when he went to prison...ell work to him meant the orderly work of followinule iurrow.
Catching alligators to—to him wasn't work in—in—by his lights anymore than struggling with that boat was work ...  ...and the solitude but she—but she wasn't enough—he had to go and get into trouble over somebody else's wife.
Yes sir.What did the tremendous wave signify and what caused ithat simply ihysical fact in that country wheevee breaks.
The water rushed through the crevasse and it—it came to the lowest place which watream which up to that time had been flowing toward the river.
This wave of water from the—at that time the river the Mississippi was—was forty feet higher than the country and when that levee gave way that—that mass of water that came through had to go somewhere and it broke on the east side of the river so that wave of water simply continued to go east until it spent itself and in this—this stream which up till that time had been flowing placidly west it turned around and ran backward.
That's jushysical fact of—of hydraulics and levee.
Yes sir.It seems that you draicture for yourself before you ... draicture.
Do you do that in your writing itself when you are writinook draw another picture for yourself before .. Oh well any writer puts down what he sees and what he hears and that image and—and that sound come from the proper blending of observation experience and imagination.
Yes you've got to see what you—the scene you describe.
You've got to hear the voice speaking the speech that you put down.
You've—you have to hear the vernacular he speaks in rather than to—to think of the speech and then translate into the vernacular.
Yes sir.Sir you want ... to establish the intellectual level of these people you're talking about buoticed we're missing this Mississippi accent which is so prevalent in those people.
You made no attempt to simulate that in the dialect.
Is there any reason for thatf the writer puts too much attention to transcribing literally the—the dialogue he hears it's confusing to people who have never heard that speech.
That is some—some of the words are difficult to spell.
They would be—tississippian he would see the words spelled the waississippian would spell it he would know how it sounded but to an outlander he wouldn't know.
He would mispronounce that word wrong.
You can—can go only so far with—with dialect and then there'oint where for—for the simple reason not to make too much demand on the writer to distract his attention from the story you're telling you've got to draw the line.
Yes sir.Sir you said imagination is enough for writing.
It makeood writer.
Do you believe that Thomas Wolfe useot of imagination in his writing or do you think that he just wrote primarily from experience think that no writer writes primarily from experience or observation or imagination.
It's as though he has three tanks with three lines and maybixing valve and he draws from that tap from all three of them and he himself can never say how much of this was imagination how much was observation how much was experience.
He—he couldn't and then he—he wouldn't bother to because that's not too important.
If what he tells seems real and seems true then how much of what came from where and when makes no difference to him.
Yes sir.It'ather small passage but in one place he's on the Indian mound with the woman and he's lost his oar and he's trying to makew one and he has this dream that he's trying—that he's back at the bunk house and he's attempting to sleep but there iule John Henry keeps trying to crawl into bed with him and he licks him with his cold tongue.
Is that supposed to have any special symbolism such as work or anything or is this—o no that's what it felt like to him when whatever the animal was that was crawling over him while he was asleep made him think of.
He—he reduced that to—to his own imagination observation and experience.
Yes sir.When did you come into the close contact witlood on the Mississippi that the text would indicate and when did you observe all these things the way the flood happened and so forth?
....  Hmmm whan't say.
I've known it all my life.
That is this country is—is not very far from wheras born and have lived all my life anave known these peopleave known that country.
Every fall as long aan remember we would go there to hunt bear and deer which was close to the levee and so we would know these people.
They would cross the levee and come into our camp.
They would—they were lawless people.
They would be beggars and on occasion they would be thieves but if we were ever benighted—lost at night—we could go to their shanty boats and shacks and they would give us what they had to eat and let us sleep that night.
Yes sir.On several occasions the tall convict is plagued by this nose bleed that he can't control.
This usually follows some period where he's hareat struggle and shown his bravery and his strength such as with the alligator.
Is this helplessness in the face of this nose bleed supposed to bumorous contrast with his strength and his usual self-sufficiency?
Or did you want to ...ell to me that was just something else comical and—and bizarre that should have—he should be afflicted with that also.
With all his other troubles he had—had that—what's the name of it the ailment when your blood won't clot?
Hemophilia.
Yes that on top of everything else he had to have that too.
Yes sir.This is just one sentence whiconder about.
In the beginning of this final chapter and you told—you sort of described the Governor's emissary and you say that he just sat down on the desk you say "almost between the warden and the caller the emissary" and you say—this is the sentence or these are the sentences "Or the vizier V-I-Z-I-E-R with the command the knotted cord has began to appear immediately."
Exactly what does that mean?
I—  Oh that's Eastern from the—the Middle East.
When the sultan decided he was tired of a—oourtier he would send his Prime Minister witnotted cord to suggest that he choke himself to death.
That's all.
Yes sir.Sir when you write any of your novels do you usually havefinite idea of how it's going to happen and outline it or do you just let the novel carry itself as you go alongometimes there is a—a general idea of what the end might be.
That is an anecdote ocene or it could bcene at the—at the first—first of the book oon't know untitart where the scene might come.
It could begin witharacter or it could begin with a—with an idea—an idea out of man's condition.
That is in Absalom Absalom!—that began with the idea oan that wanted—a ruthless man that wanteon and got so many that they destroyed one another and destroyed him but the idea almost at once produced the protagonist which was the man himself.
Some writerhink have to havlot.
They—they do research.
They have notebooks and graphs and charts and things buever have worked that way.
Mine begin with—with a—a scene or an anecdote to write toward or witharacter and after the characters the people come alive then all the writer has to do is to trot along beside them witotebook anencil and put down what they say and do.
Of course at the end you've got to—to use some discipline to do editing to pick and choose and make the—give the whole thing coherence and emphasis at the right place and unity but with me the characters take charge of the story and alave to do is just put down what they do and say.
Yes sir.Sir this is slightly pointing out toward another tangent.
We were haviniscussion in our class as to whether Ernest Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls was didactic or not.
... Would you give your opinion to that would say simply that Hemingway was writing—well iense the same story—every writer iay is writing one story.
That he—there's one thing in man's condition that seems to him the most moving the most tragic and this time Hemingway was writing the story which still seemed to him moving and tragic which like all writers he never had told well enough to please him.
This one was brought into urgency by the—the condition gap in tape that he was not really writing primarily about the Spanish Civil War but he was writing about the—the human condition which to him was moving and tragic in the terms of that war.
Yes sir.Does the writer write usually from urge or froense of ... little of bothhink that—that most writers are demon-driven.
Whether to say that it's—he has to or—or whether it's an urge it's difficult to say but he is driven bemon that he has found this world amazing and—and disturbing or tragic or comic or anyway passionate enough so that he has got to use the time he's on earth to express maybe his appreciation of the fact that he lived foittle while.
Maybe he's iay saying "Much obliged God thaas here fohile."
It—it'emon that he's driven by that.Does the writer ever get involved in more than one book ... aimeh yes.
Yes I've written—one timas working on three at one timeave written awhile on one and put it aside and then write another then come back to the first one again.
Let's see.
We'll have to start at the left.
Yes sir.Does the—does the convict in "The Old Man" gain his strength from the fact that he does have the mind oixteen- or seventeen-year-old and his perceptions are limitedouldn't say he gained his strength from thatould say that he gained his strength because he had a—a—a very simple moral standard.
That he made one aberration from it because he was tempted by Delilah but he would—he would never make that aberration again and he—the—he—the reason for the security he wanted was that he would never be tempted he would believe that—that he wouldn't that his own strength would keep him from being taken over the hurdles by another woman like that but he wasn't too sure.
He knew as long as he was in that—that penitentiary and he was expiating the crime—he did something wrong he knew that and he was expiating his crime.
He was doing the best he could to leaecent life while he was there to expiate his crime against society.
He had a—a standard of morals and that wahink his strength.
He had been sent out to—to rescue two people ilood and he did the best he could to rescue both of them and bring them back.
That tooertain sort of morality to do that.
He could have escaped at any time but he didn't.
Yes sir.Do you condone his attempt to—to escape from his insecurity?ean do you think it's commendable to do what one wants even though it's escape or do you think that one should try and better himself.
And should he have becomrustee and—and attempted to face life more squarely think people should never judge one another.
Least of all should the writer judge his charactershink that—that man is—is trying to do better than he thinks he can maybe that he wants to be braver more honorable.
He wants to—to have compassion.
He's—he's afraid that maybe he won't that maybe he won't be as brave as he wants to be and then suddenly something happens and he finds to his astonishment that he was as brave as he wanted to be that he is as honorable as he wanted to be that he does have compassion sould—I would never judge himould—I would say about him that—that within his—his lights to have accepteondition and to do the best he can in it whether that—that best is very intelligent or not is not too important.
The fact is that by his lights he's doing the best he can iondition.
He's not whining to anybody.
He didn't ask for—for that condition but there it is and he's going to do the best in it.
He's not going to whine anhink that's admirable.
Yes sir.Sir you have painted his fellow convicts as being almost animals—they turn their backs to the rain and they crowd around the empty stove in the train and they—they seem to have absolutely no personality.
They're—they're just animals.
Would the tall convict have been exactly the samee would yes.
That is the—the result of having been in prison.
Being in prison makean an animal.
What it divides—deprives him of is the thing that differentiates him from beast which is the capacity for free will for liberty freedom and so of course they were animals to turn their backs tain and—and—and hover over the symbol of—of heat and warmth.
That's the bad thing about prison about deprivation of simple liberty and free will—worst thing can happen to you.
Yes sir.Did you show that the convict had high moral standards in one sense ... by emphasizing the moral standards of Charlotte and Harry and ...o noasn't interested in the convict's moral standards any more thaas interested in Harry's and Charlotte'sas simply writing about peopleas writing the story of—oan anoman who—who threw away everything for love and the story wasn't—wasn't emphasized it wasn't moving enough so I—I wrote the second story of—oan anoman who got the very thing that Harry and Charlotte had thrown away everything to have and wasn't happy until the man the convict got rid of itasn't writing about their moral standards.
They themselves exposed their moral standards to me simply by doing and saying things whicranscribe put down.
Yes sir.Sir when you writook do you write just to or aertain group of people because wheerson starts reading your book his first shock as you said was the length of your sentences first of all and by the insight which is required to get to the meat out of the story to get the meaning that you want to convey.
Do you write to an above average class of people ohould say way above average class of peopleon't think any writer does thatnow that in my own casrote books for years before it ever occurred to me that strangers might read them.
The writer is demon-driven.
He is writing something which seemed to him so—so moving so tragic so passionate that he had to—to put it down in his short span on this earth if for no other reason than to saas here.
That he is not writing at—at the time when the—when the fire is hot and the demon has—is really got him at a—a dead run for anybody.
He's simply trying to put—put this—this passionate dream that he has seen or imagined down.
Later on he begins to realize that people do read it but at the time he—he's not interested in that.
He hasn't thought about that.
The first one wasn't good enough so he's busy writing another one.
He hasn't had time yet to realize that people will read it.
Yes sir.Judging from that sir you might say your idea—your idea orue author isn't one who sculpts his material toward the commercial sidehat's right.
Yes if—if what he wants is money then there are probably easier ways to make money than being an authorhink that—that the young man or young woman that wants to write will have to make that choice.
He has got to decide "Dant to do this becausavemon that won't let me alone or dant to make some money at this think in the case of—of the men and women who have been the good writers that choice never occurred to them that they had never had to stop to decide "I—I havhoice to make now which shalhoose" because he has made that choice.
The alternative has never occurred to him any more than he would choose "Now shalriter or shalankerhat if he wants to banker he will banker but he will briter too.
If he wants to boctor he will boctor but if he haemon to write he will still briter too.
He will find plenty of time to briter bainter be anything else.
Yes sir.Have you been approached and I'm sure you have to express yourself iedium other thaook olay?
For instance have you ever been asked to writelevision play oovie that implies ....  Well wheave needed moneave worked for moving pictures and television but that was simply a—a pleasant way to geheck every Saturday night and it had nothing to do with writing.
It was jusob.
Yes sir.Would you comment on drama aiterary form putting on the plays that perhaps were never meant for production.
Do you like this type of artelhink that—that the—the play is—or—or the—the novel the short story that is—iedium which fits the writer's temperament best.
It may be that someone who thinks in term of—of the drama sees more of what he wants to write than he hears.
Maybe the—the man who—or woman who instinctively takes the novel form hears voices rather than sees.
That is a—a matter of—of probably individual temperament and character which method is the one that you can—can do what is to yourself the most satisfactory work which is the primary reason why the writer writes is—is for himselfhink that—that—that all writers wanted to be poets maybe which is the highest form.
Then they would accept having failed to be poets to write the poetry which was as good as—as they wanted it to be as they dreamed it to be.
Then he would take whatever medium is closest to his own nature and character which could be the stage or could be short stories or could be novels.
Yes sir.I was just wondering one of your short stories "A Rose For Emily" what ever inspired you to write this story ...hat to me was—was another sad and tragic manifestation of man's condition in which he—he dreams and hopes in which he is in conflict with himself or with his environment or with others.
In this case there was the young girl witoung girl's normal aspirations to find love and theusband anamily who was browbeaten and—and kept down by her fatheelfish man who—who didn't want her to leave home because he wanteousekeeper and it waatural instinct repressed which—which you can't repress it.
You can mash it down but it comes up somewhere else in a—very likelragic form and that was simply another manifestation of man's injustice to man of—of the poor tragic human being struggling with its own heart with others with its environment for the simple things which all human beings want.
In that case it waoung girl that—that just wanted to be loved and to love and to havusband anamily.And that purely came from your imaginationell the story did but the—the condition is—is there.
It existsidn't invent that condition.
I—I didn't invent the fact that young girls dream of—of someone to love and children anome but the story of what her own particular tragedy was was invented yes.
Yes sir.Concerninable which I—in my humble opinion is your greatest book although the critics didn't seem to think so.
What sir prompted you to write along those lines the history oattlefield in France during the First World War and the mutinies in the French Army and—  That was the only boover wrote that came from an intellectual idea purely and simply.
It was the—the thought occurred to me who might that be under the splendid marble cenotaph with the eternal fire burning over it forever and forever.
That if—suppose that had been Christ.
If Christ had—had returned again of course he would have been crucified again which would be twice and maybe just maybe man would not be offered but one more chance.
I'm sure that we all thank you ... to go on buanted to give you an opportunity to no longer be subjected to questions.
I'm sure that we all appreciate  's coming and that we've learnereat deal from his remarks.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
...pick up from where he left off this morning—  whaould sort of like to ask you is after four months of contact with students at the University sort of what you feel in the rising generation whether—we've hearot of talk that they are very much driven toward conformity and security just the thinghink that you probably would oppose in anyone who wanted to briter.
But I'm thinking more of what you see in the students you've talked toell me that againot lost.
I'm sorry ... my sentence was involved.
What I—what I'm thinking of is what you—what you think of the generations of students that you've had contact with over the last four months here and possiblear or so ago—well let's limit it to the United States.
Are they more conventional than they were when they—when you were their age?
Are they more seeking of conformity?
What—well what—are they less intellectually curious?
Are they less daringould say that they are more intellectually curious.
They are more daring but they have more pressure to conform.
There's—there's more and more constant pressure to belong to something to be submerged intass that they have got to—got to struggle with.
Buould say that they are—they are more curious than they were that they have more opportunities to be curious to—to know to keep up with what—what cooks what does go on.
But there is that—that tremendous pressure to conform whichink they don't—don't always realize is there.Well do you think most of them are resisting it?ould doubt it.hink that all young people resist it but there's no ordered resistance.
They themselves don't—don't realize how much and how constant that pressure is or that they would confederate against it.
They are given too many things that take the form of—of bribery to not resist it to be unaware of it.What sort of briberyell the—the—the pleasant things of—of—of existence of beintudent the motor cars and the—the things that make the—the day-by-day life otudent simpler than it used to be when there was some question to keep warm in winter.
You had to go tittle trouble to keeire going if nothing else.
There were—it waittle more difficult to—to find pleasure.
You couldn't go out and go to the theater by paying sixty or seventy cents at the moving-picture show every night.
The books were not always available.
And because things like that are available the student is—the young man is—is tricked into not realizing the—the pressure on him to belong tass oroup which wants to do his thinking for him to give him the ideas that that group that—of the overlords of the group and mass want him to have.
But I'm convinced he still resists it and it breaks out in all sorts of—of queer and unpredictable places.What are they sirelhink of young  Plowden-Wardlaw whose avocation seems to be taking part ialypso band yet suddenly he and his friends on the magazine here have thought of that issue stating different notions about segregation.
That's interesting.
He should—they should do more with that.
There should be more of that in the Universithink than there is.
But that'ery gooery hopeful symptom.You said something about wishing that the University of Virginia and the State of Virginia would take more leadership in the South.
You were asked that question the other night in conversation.
Well yes that's because of the—the respectful almost abject reverence which the rest of the South has toward the State of Virginia and toward the University that when the State of Virginia makes mistakes which should have been made not by Virginia but by Mississippi or Alabama we arittle ashamed.Do you have any mistakes in mindell the unhappy business of the invitations they sent out for that dinner and they found that some of them had gone to Negroes and they had to recall them that sort of thing.
That's the sort of thing that you expect Mississippi to do but not Virginia.
To the—the rest of the South Virginia must be like Caesar's wife.
last week you went to selay written by one of the students hereould be interested in any comments you would care to make on the play.
Hopeful.
It was another instance of—of—of that pressure to conformhink that a—a sad and tragic thinondition which the—the young writer today has to face is that the middle class has been broken down.
It no longer exists as a—a homogeneous condition recognized by everyone everywhere.
It exists but it exists as—as you might say individual cells.
The—the best of the writing of the old days—not so much done by members of the middle class but it was about the—the tragedies the problems which existed in the middle class and now there's no middle class anymore as a—a—a—a definite condition recognizable everywhere to create those problems and so the—the plays have a—a flavoittle too preciously proletarian that they are concerned with conditions and not problems of the human heart.
Coffey's play showed a—it was—was very hopefuhink.
It—it showed a—a sense of—of his craft and it was very well done to have been done by amateurs because that was pretty difficult for amateurs to do that sort of thing to make it believable.
you say the middle class but if there is no more middle class what do you think has happened to the middle class when there was oneonditions of over-population the—the confederation of the—the various labor unions which are—are—have transposed are transposing what was the proletariat intew middle class.
I—by the middle class having hard and fixed recognizable boundarieean that class which decreed that—that there should be banktable currency.
There should be churches.
There should be schoolslass in which even the ones who couldn't cope financially were still supported by the middle class.
They still belonged to it.
Now that class doesn't exist with the rigid boundaries so that—that when the—the ex-member of it the member of what was the middle class has failed financially he is submerged.
He is passed by people who rise through the old middle class without having learned any of the discipline the responsibility of their class oiddle class.Is part of that transition what you recorded in The Town?Well it's—what everybody writing recordshink it's—it definitely iact and every—... rise.
Well people like the Snopeses always have risen—risen iountry like this where there is freedom in which to—to make the best of your capacities.
But there was no middle class to give hiheck—probably he couldn't have risen as rapidly as he did fifty years ago when there waefinite and rigid middle class.
I'm interested in something that seems to have happened to you.
It seemed to me using the Nobel Prize aark in time rather than any special significance that you seem to have moved tertain extent from communicating only through your works to—well for example going to Japan or coming to the University of Virginia and going to other places for the State Departmentondered if this marked any sort of change or departure in your own thinking or sort of why you moved out.
Well sir you are constantly changing.
Your skin your fingernails is constantly changing.
The—the only alternative you know is death.
And let's hope that we won't have to keep on doing tomorrow what we are doing today.
There wouldn't be much fun in it Yes sir.In your talk to the students you said aemember that it'uestion whether Southern Baptists are religious anas wondering if you could elaborate on that and say if they are not religious then what are theyell they're laughter Southern Baptisthink that is an—an emotional condition that has nothing to do with God or  politics or anything else.What is involved in this emotional condition of the Southern—Southern Baptistt came from—from times of hardship in the South where there was little or no food for the human spirit where there were no books no theater no music and life was pretty hard.
It—a lot of it happened out in the sun for very little reward and that was the only escape they hadhink that is the—the human spirit aspiring toward something.
Of course it got warped and twisted in the process.Now this—this condition do you limit that to Southern Baptists or do you visualize something larger than actually the Baptist churches in the Southelmagine that it exists almost everywhere though it may take other forms.
It would exist wherever people have been starved spiritually starved.
one other question can you—have you gotten anything particularly out of this four months in Charlottesville yourself and can you at this point in any way distill sort of any feeling you might have about Charlottesville and about the Universityhe writer writes from the three tankpoke of—observation imagination and experience.
He's got to constantly replenish them and fill them and so I—I couldn't say exactly what I've got from my—my stay here to replenish those tanks though the tanks have been replenished because as—as we agreed life is in constant flux in constant change and the time that you don't learn something new every day you're dead.Based on your four months heras wondering if your opinion of university education or college education has changed.
Anderstand when you first came here you said thaniversity—a college education was good for some people and not—not necessary for others anas wondering if—whether your opinion has been modified at all.
No because I've had that opinion for about fifty years.
I—I think that—that all education in this country has got to be overhauledhink that there's a—it's basically bad when—when its premise is that everybody must be educated willy nilly that some people don't deserve to be educated and if everyone is to be educated unless enough money is spent on education to where the—the best student can have the best of the treatment the best of the education then he is going to have to be stultified and held back bcheme which has got to take the—the one that is least fitted.
Probably the—the ideal form of education would be one professor to one student or one professor to no more than ten students.Last week you were talking about the cultural interchange through the State Department and wishing more of it could be done and done better.
Do you care to comment on that think my opinion is that we go about it the wrong way.
We should stop trying to sell our country to Europe or to anywhere else.
We should bring the people that don't like our country to this country and let them alone and let them see what it is about it that makes us like it.
That it's—we—we try to—to chooseople who are already our friends and then sell them some illusory picture of America.
Let's bring our enemies here.
We—we can't keep communist spies out of this country anyway.
You might just as well bring all the communists that will come here and let them see what there is about this country that makes us like it not try to sell them anything.
Just let them seountry where everybody haob and he can always hope foadillac.
His children can go to the corner drugstore and—and get an ice cream cone every day buy all the junk that Americans love on the installment plan.
audience laughteYes sir.Do you think the thing that has broken down the middle class is materialismo it's the—the—the terrific increase of population people that have got to be cared for that if we had spent as much attention to breeding people as we do to breeding horses and dogs we would've had a—a better world probably and stayed out oot of trouble.
Changing conditions.
The machine is responsible foreat deal of it the machine that has given us more leisure than we have taught ourselves what to do withYes sir.You—your statements that you think education should be overhauled and you said that you thought it would do good to—if possible to have maybe one professor to one student or one to ten students and that generallelieve is what colleges are trying to work for.
Now do you think they are on the right track generally or do you think they are making some mistakes and if so what mistakes'm sure that they are working toward something like that or maybe eveetter idea and I'm convinced too that—that with—with all the—the problems the— the—the social problems which we face which is the leisure that we don't know what to do with with too many people with the need for housing that it's amazing that the—the colleges advance as they do.
That is if—if suddenly things could be stopped to give the colleges one year in which to make their plans they might do something but now they can't because here's another flux of—of young men and women that have got to go to school and they don't have any chance to stop and get their breath and take stock and make plans.What comparison if any can you make really between the Japanese students you talked to at Nagano and elsewhere and the ones you've found here don't think that anyone can understand Japanese so the impressioot could be completely wrong you see.
The impressioot is that they are—that their culture iulture of—of—how to phrase it?
Of the functioning of the—of the intellect not intelligence but of the intellect the—the little clicking of—of—of the wheels that turn and then just what it produces don't matter just so the—all the little wheels are running constantly.You've madomparison the other night of students different types of students in Austrielieve.
Isn't that trueell sion't remember.
I've donot of talking in these four months but you'd have to look  at the tape recorder to remember just what it was.At the University of—it would've been at the University of Vienna don't know.
Keep on.
Maybe I'll remember it.Witroup who were studying—to whom you were talking in English—were studying for Foreign Service and had definite ideas of what they wanted and so forth.
...
They were much more seriously interested in ....on't know.
Can you help us out on that?
No siron't recall that question or that answer.
Do you remember any more of it  Ranick?
Maybe we'll get to it iinute.No.
I—that—I was asking partly trying to find what the answer was becausissed part of itas too far back in the room to catch it all.emember you stated ....  in this cultural interchange you speak of wouldn't the student serve as well the student maybe and his family and ... the communists ...ow would you go about arranging something like that would import the whole family.
The—the first requirement would be that be communistsould bring the whole family intactould arrange for labor to find a—a—a job for hiouse for him and schools for his children.
Let them stay two years and then send them back and then bring another intact family.
Yes to bring the father and the mother and—and two or three children and not bother them at all.
Just let them see this country how it actually is instead of trying to give them the—the false phony picture which the people that put out our propaganda seem to think it is.Do you feel that if you had been born and grown up someplace else you would've written pretty much the same kind of book laid in the environment there or do you think Mississippi is particularly strong in bringing out the—these conditions in the human raceo no the imagination would be the same.
The observation we— would be different and assuming that—that the experience the—the books were—were Russian books or French books that would bittle different.I mean—  But the peoplrite about are the same people.
People haven't changed that much.
The—the locale is—is just incidental.
The writer uses that because that's easier.You wouldn't say there's anything significant about—  No.—about ... Mississippi beyond—  No it's just because it's there.
That's easier.
Irote about another locale I'd have to do some research or risk somebody saying "Uh-uh that's wrong."
Do you feel you would have been influenced also probably to write the same type of thinges people are the same.
People don't change that much.
Their problems are the same problems.
you may have touched on this previously but could you give some advice to young writers?
What advice would you give to young writerst one timhought the most important thing was talenthink now that—that the young man or the young woman must possess or teach himself train himself in infinite patience which is to—to try and to try and to try until it comes right.
He must train himself in ruthless intolerance.
That is to throw away anything that is false no matter how much he might love that page or that paragraph.
The most important thing is insight that is to be—to curiosity—to—to wonder to mull and to—to—to muse why it is that man does what he does.
And if you have that theon't think the talent makes much difference whether you've got that or not.How would you suggest that he get this insight?
Through experiencees and then the greatest part of experience is in the books to read.
To read and to read and to read and to read.
To watch people to have—to never judge people.
To watch people what they do with—with—without intolerance.
Simply to—to learn why it is they did what they did.elieve earlier you were talking about reading when you were speaking to the class anot of it was about symbolism.
You said since the writers cannot folloot of turns and corners the symbols and must get on with the writing and that's for the reader to follow upas wondering when you did your reading did you follow the turns and the corners in—in looking for symbolismidn't.
The—the reader reads out of the same three reservoirs—imagination observation and experience that the writer writes from.
The—the reader and the writer in the same culture have the same cultural background.
That is the same religious symbols arart of—of both backgrounds and it's—the writer by simple instinct will match those symbols and the old stories of his folklore for the reason that there're—there're only two or three stories anyone can write and they are bound to repeat themselves.
There're onlertain number of symbols which are the cultural background the spiritual background of anyone and of course they're going to appear when he begins to translate his own observation and imagination and experience onto paper.
He will use the terms of his environment anart of his environment is the—the symbolism which he inherited took in with his mother's milk you might say aart of his own past of the—the long generations which—which bought him to A.D. 1957 and so it's not surprising that they should all be there and it's not surprising that he taking them for granted doesn't bother to—to see "Well here's where I've useymbol and sot this symbol how many years ago."
That's not too important to him.
It's there.
have you found any promising young writers during your stay here anyone who looks good for the future of fictionny promising young writer to me is one that's really working at it.
His promise will be in the work.
The—the—the symptom of promise is that he really is interested enough to—to accept the anguish and the frustration and the disappointment and—and the final fun and—and ecstasy of working at it so any young man that is sincerely working at it and sincerely interested in—in the—the verities of man's condition shows promise.
It may take him years before he lives up to that promise but if he's working at it that's all the promise he needs to give anybody.
Yes sir.What specifically in your memory did you—you read that helped you more than anything elseverythinver read from the telephone book up and down.
Trash.
The good stuff.
All of it.It all—  Anhink that no writer can say just how much influence he had from what source.
That is he might be able to go back over his work and pick out pages or scenes or chapters that show—shoerivation fropecific source but then the writer don't do that because by that time he's busy writing another book.
That he feels at—at perfect liberty to take whatever he needs from whatever source he can find it just as he is perfectly willing to let anyone after him take whatever they can get from him with no jealousy whatever or no feeling that he has—has—what he—he's amoral not immoral.
Yes sir.To return to the idea about—about bringing in communists and—and letting them live here and—and see our way of life and—and not bother them and—well along that idea—you said that usually—you think they would return witetter picture of America than they're getting through our propaganda anas wondering if you had any—what kind of picture do you think they're getting nowt would brue picturehink the picture that they get from what we export is norue picture of America because we want to be liked.
We wanted to be thought well of and despite ourselves we dress up the image that we send abroad simply because we want to be liked and want to be thought well of but that ain't it.
It's to let them see themselves what it is in this country that makes us for some strange reason like it.Have you given this enough consideration that you would probably be tempted to write ..will reaonderful passage from his new novel The Town this afternoon and thereafter answer any questions from the floor.
You may be interested to know that your opinion of the temperature of this room as time goes on is shared by the writer-in-residence who calls it "The Black Hole."
But you might feel reassured iemind you that this is not merely the only room in the University that fits exactly the acoustics of  's voice but it's partly our contribution to acclimatizing him for his return tississippi summer.
For he must return he says after one of the most exciting terms for us.
And in valedictory one is tempted to point with local pride now tlong with Messrs. Jefferson and Poe.
He has spent almost as much time at the University as Poe did.
His—his  work like that of Poe which seemed Gothic at one time to many readers turns out to be not of Germany but of the soul as Poe said himself.
And he has proven himselentleman of not only of Mississippi or Virginia but like Thomas Jefferson of the world.
And possibly this afternoon our response may help to induce him to return next year.
This return would be that of the most distinguished writer of fiction in the world todaypplauseeckon the only waan live up to that encomium is by going back to Mississippi right away.
There iidge; you drive on beyond Seminary Hill and in time you come upon iild unhurried farm road presently mounting to cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from Jefferson to the world.
And now looking back and down you see all Yoknapatawpha in the dying last of day beneath you.
There are stars now just pricking out as you watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning; the end of day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith.
Yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth drained from earth backward and upward into that cooling green but rather had gathered pooling for an unmoving moment yet among the low places of the ground so that ground earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are dark standing darkly and immobile—immobile out of it.
Then as though at signal the fireflies—lightning-bugs of the Mississippi child's vernacular—myriad and frenetic random and frantic pulsing; not questing not quiring but choiring as if they were tiny incessant appeaseless voices cries words.
And you stand suzerain and solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath that incessant ephemeral spangling.
First is Jefferson the center radiating weakly its puny glow into space; beyond it enclosing it spreads the County tied by the diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hub by its spokes yourself detached as God Himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and women who made you the record and chronicle of your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past; you to preside unanguished and immune above this miniature of man's passions and hopes and disasters—ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation and pity and honor and sin and pride all bound precarious and ramshackle held together by the web the iron-thin warp and woof of his rapacity but withal yet dedicated to his dreams.
They are all here supine beneath you stratified and superposed osseous and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms—the rich alluvial river-bottom land of old Issetibbeha the wild Chickasaw king with his Negro slaves and his sister's son called Doom who murdered his way to the throne and legend said (record itself said since there were old men in the county in my own childhood who had actually seen it) stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert intalace proper to aggrandise his state; the same fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether we—I mean of course they—ever actually ownelantation or not Sutpen and Sartoris and Compson and Edmonds and McCaslin and Beauchamp and Grenier and Habersham and Holston and Stevens and De Spain generals and governors and judges soldiers (even if only Cuban lieutenants) and statesmen failed or not and simple politicians and over-reachers and just simple failures who snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished name and face and all.
Then the roadless almost pathless perpendicular hill-country of McCallum and Gowrie and Frazier and Muir translated intact with their pot stills and still speaking only the old Gaelic and not much of that from Culloden to Carolina then from Carolina to Yokpatawpha still intact and still not speaking much of anything except that now they called the pots "kettles" though the drink (evean remember this) was still usquebaugh; then and last on to where Frenchman's Bend lay beyond the southeastern horizon cradle of Varners and ant-heap of the northeast crawl of Snopes.
And you stand there—you the old man already white-headed (because it doesn't matter if they call your gray hairs premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and anguishes) and pushing forty onlew years from forty—while there rises up to you proffered up to you the spring darkness the unsleeping darkness which although is—it is of the dark itself declines the dark since dark is of the little death called sleeping.
Because look how even though the last of west is no longer green and all of firmament is now one unlidded studded slow-wheeling arc and the last of earth-pooled visibility has drained away there still remains one faint diffusion since everywhere you look about the dark panorama you still see them faint as whispers the faint and shapeless lambence of blooming dogwood returning loaned light to light as the phantoms of candles would.
And you the old man standing there while there rises to you about you suffocating you the spring dark peopled and myriad two and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy the privacy decreed and created for them by the spring darkness the spring weather the spring which an American poeine onoman and so she knows called girls' weather and boys' luck.
Which was not the first day at all not Eden morning at all because girls' weather and boys' luck is the sum of all the days the cup the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no more; proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even then—that sometimes premature too soon.
Because the tragedy of life is it must be premature inconclusive and inconcludable in order to be life; it must be before itself in advance of itself to have been at all.
There's no questionshis is the point in the program at whicsually consents to answer questions on many subjects.
I'm sure he will entertain them now.
Not consent but anxious to do.
Anybody likes to stand up in front oot of nice people and talk and nobody can say "Shut up and sit down."
mask why in some of your writing that you use long—such long sentences and almost eliminate punctuation?ave in minase in point the first story in Go Down Mosehink you call it "Was."
Yes ma'am.
The reason for that ihink that every man every writer haoreknowledge of death as everyone does.
He realizes that he has onlimited time in which to do the work he wants to do.
He has found being alive so amazing and so marvelous that he has got to—to transcribe it onto paper to shape it.
And hhink is—is trying to—to tell the whole passion of man's condition his hopes his fears his aspirations in the short time he has to live before he dies and so by instinct if he don't watch himself he tries to put everything into one long sentence like the—  like the—the man that used to inscribe all of the "Lord's Prayer" on the head oin.
That he must do it while he has breath to do it in.
Yes siryour publishers have announceequel to The Town.
..hink this is the first time this has happened to you ariter being under that kind of pressure or—or no ...he pressure is not actually from the publisher.
Wheirst thought of—of these people and the idea of—oribe of people which would come into an otherwise peaceful little southern town like—like ants or—or like mold on cheese then—I discovered then that to tell the story properly would be too many words to compress into one volume.
It had to be two or three.
So the pressure has been on me beforver told the publisher about it—thaould have to keep on writing about these people untiot it all told anssume that one more book will do it thougon't have any great hopes that it will.
audience laughte Yes sir.Do you write in regular hours or do you write in irregular hourso sir.
By naturm completely disorderlyever have learned to—to hang up anything or put anything back wherot it and sork when—well as the—the athlete says when I'm hot.
Anon't like to work.
I'm by nature lazyill put it off as long aan.
Then wheet started it's—it's funhink the reason anyone writes is because it's fun and you like it.
That's just your cup of tea.
And sill write untiave to make myself stop because I've found that—that the only rule for writinave is to—to leave it while I'm still hot—while I'm still looking good as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes puts it—so thaan take up again tomorrow.
But I've have never had any order.
Some people are orderly.
They—they lay oulot or synopsis first.
They make notes which is valid and satisfactory for them but not for meould be completely lost.
Probably if I'd begun to makew noteould say "Oh well that's all you don't need to work anymore" and I'd quit.
Shinut off working as long as possible and do as much of the research and the note-filing up here and then begin to write.
in your actual composition do you write everything out in longhand or do you type or have somebody ..
Yes sirrite it out in longhand becausever have learned to think good onto the typewriter.
That I've got to—got to feel the pencil and see the words at the end of the pencil.
Then if it's the wrong word it's simple enough to scratch it out and try it again.
I—I reckoas—started writing too soon to have taken the typewriter as an extension of the hands as—as the young man nowadays can doave to put—put it down on paper first.
After thao the rewriting on the typewriter but something has got to be on paper first for me to look at and get the feel.How fast do you dash it off sir?
So fast that somebody said my handwriting looks likaterpillar that crawled through an ink well and out on tiece of paper.
Ieave it until tomorroan't read it myself  so it's got to be put down quick and then typed quick.
Yes ma'am.
... how do you ... advantage to being pessimisticelhink the—the writer's aim is not deliberately to be pessimistic.
His aim is to—to show people human beings in the human condition faced with the tragedies and the aspirations the hopes which all people are faced with in the most moving way he can.
If his outlook is—is pessimistic it's simply because—that is not—not his—his intention to be pessimistic.
It's—it's because having watched people in their confusion and their aspirations that are—what—what he gets is an immediate feeling of pessimism though the very fact that he keeps on trying to write about people implies that that he has some hope for man that he sees man as trying to do better than he does to be more honest than he is to be braver.
That the pessimism is a—a matter of the moment.
Maybe the writer does want to do his—his bit toward making man better and maybe he thinks if he shows man in his moments of baseness it may be—besson to someone either don't do this or—oeminder even when people do do this at other times they do good things fine things.
That they will do things that other people shan't suffer.
Yes sir.Do you always know how the book's going to come out before you starting writing ito sion't.
The—the trick is to—to get the characters and—and work at them until they stand on their own feet and take three dimensions and cashadow and begin to move.
After that all the writer has to do is to run along behind them witotebook  and put down what they say and do but he himself onyway don't know where they're going.
All I—I know is that they're alive and they're in motion and ian keep up and write fast enougon't miss anything.Do you expect them to prove ...nly to the point that they are alive and that the reader will believe that they are alive.
They may do things that shock him and outrage him and that he doesn't like but—but my hope is he'll say "Well they are alive anyway.
They're scoundrels and rascals but they are alive."
That is—is the hophink that any writer has—that people he creates are credible that the—the comedy the tragedy they run into the—the silly things they do are things that are—are within the scope of—ouman being to do.
Yes sir—yes ma'am.
when you wrote The Sound and the Fury why did you suddenly switch from the first person ...hat book began as—as so many books do with—with an anecdoticture.
The picture was of both children who had been sent from the house.
They didn't know why.
Something was taking place in the house in the parlor and like children they were curious to know what it was and the only one that was brave enough to climb the tree was the little girl and the book grew from that.
It started off to bimple short storyrote the—the first section which was the idiot brother'sealized that that wasn't enoughadn't told that story.
Set another brother try to tell it.
That's the second sectionealized that still wasn't enoughadn't told that story set the second brother try which was the third section.
That still wasn't enough so thead  try it.
And—and still it was not enoughtill haven't told the story to suit me.
That's the reason that to me is the one I—I love the dearest that I'm the most fond of because that was the most splendid failure antill haven't told that storyelieve that iad it to do oveould do it better.
Of coursouldn't.
But that's the one booisadn't written sould write it now.
Yes sir.
you've spoken frequentlelieve—about various ways that you've failed giving us the impression that you—you never feel as if you've quite expressed yourself.
Is it really so hardhat's righthink that's true of any writer.
That's why he writes another book.
If he wrote the book that pleased him absolutely that was perfect by his own standards then nothing remains but to cut his throat but that book fails so he writes another one.
He believes that the next one won't fail.
Of course it will.
Which is good for him because that keeps him working anhink that no life is as happy as—as a—a life in which you've tried to make something which wasn't here before—a picture oymphony oook oiece of sculpture and that is to me the best life of all.
Noappy life because it's filled with—with anger frustration because it's not perfect—of rage and exhaustion but it's—it's reallatchless lifeouldn't put any other occupation above ithink that—thaan that can ded—a young man young woman who can dedicate himself or herself to that simple idea to make something which didn't exist before.
It is the best life ...
Yes sir.Mask how much your daily variations of mood affect the actions of your characters?
Suppose one day you get up feeling fine do your characters seem to take oheerful aspect?
I—I don't believe sohink that—that anyone the painter the musician the writer works in a—a kind of an—an insane fury.
He's demon-driven.
He can get up feeling rotten witangover or with—with actual pain and—and if he gets to work the first thing he knows he don't remember that pain that hangover—he's too busy.
That his—his feeling—I doubt if that reflects too much in his work.
That he can wake up and go to work feeling good and the first thing he knows he doesn't remember whether he feels good or not—he's too busy.
That he is in the—in the clutch oemon then.
Yes ma'am.
does that mean that he also ... impervious to atmosphere ...o nohink the writer any artist is—is completely amoral.
He's—robs and steals everywhere he can find anything he might need.
The atmosphere he has—he's gathered up from observation from experience just from living and breathing.
He stole that away and then when he needs it to put into what he writes he hunts around in his trash bin or his lumber room and picks out the atmosphere or the symbolism or the style whatever he needs but he has—has acquired that long before he sits down to write.
At the time he's writing he's like the carpenter buildinence ohicken coop that he's busy sawing planks and driving nails—that he has already got his—his supply of nails and his boards at hand where he can reach back into his workshop and get what plank or what size nails he needs.
Yes ma'am.Do you feel that the people you associated with in Mississippi—old cronies and so forth—do you feel like ...?
As far anow they do because the friendave are—are not literary friends.
They are people engaged in other pursuits and unless I'm as good in their pursuits as they are they have of coursow opinion of me.
If I'm as good in—in their pursuits that is farming or hunting or with horses as they are then they havigh opinion of me which has nothing to do with my books because they don't read my books.
Some artist said that nobody in Mississippi reads; they're all writing.
Yes sir.I want to ask youestion about The Town.
The—the heroine of this story Eula Varner Snopes at the end commits suicide.
What do you think was her reason for itt was for the sake of that child.
She at that—that time had realized that—that every child a—a young girl especially needed the—the semblance of an intact home—that is to havother anather to have the same things that the other children had.
And she had reached an impasse where—where her—her lover would have demanded that—that she leave her—her husband and then that child would have found out that—that it had grown up iroken home.
Up to this time whether the child loved Flem or not at least he was the symbol of the father which all the other children had and with—the mother felt it would be better for this girl to have a—a mother who committed suicide thaother who ran off witover which was—that may have been the wrong decision she made but that was the decision she did make—that at least this girl would've—would've had the—the similitude of an intact though a— tragedy—tragedy-ridden home just as other children did.Do you by chance have in mind writing the story of this daughter nowes sir.
That will be in the—in the next book.
She's one of the most interesting people I've written about yehink.
Her story will be in the next book.
Yes ma'am.
how do you feel about the use of symbols.
That seems to be quite the rage now.
Do you consciously use symbols in your writingot deliberately.
The—the symbolism iart of anyone's past.
By—I mean by that his environment his background his experience his observation.
Anart of that background is—is the Christian religion.
The writer is engaged primarily in—in writing about people.
He's doing this in the most moving and most effective way he knows and the symbolism like the style they are the—the nails and the boards in—in the carpenter's workshop and these symbols appear almost by coincidence in what he does.
He's simply writing out of his own background of observation and experience—that he hasn't got time to say "Now I'm going to usymbol."
He's too busy writing about simple men and women engaged in—in the tragedy of man's condition engaged in the conflict with the human heart or with its fellows or with its environment its background anhink that the reader must read any book from the same background which the writer writes it from that is from the background of observation experience and imagination and so the reader reads into the book finds in the book symbolism which the writer didn't know was there and is not really interested in finding there.
He was too busy but he doesn't doubt that—that that symbol—symbolism is there or even if it were not what symbolism is there could be translated into someone else's understanding and comprehension.
That ihinese could probably find Chinese symbolism in an American book just as the American can find American symbolism ihinese oapanese bookYes'm.I heard of your article in Ebony magazine giving advice to the colored people as to the way they should act toward integration.
What was your advice and do you think that they are heeding it in any way would like to think that some do.
The advice was simply that—that no law or edict passed by no matter whom is going to change the social condition until the people involved in that condition wish it changed.
That is if the Negro were given equality bolice force he would keep that equality only as long as the police stood there.
When the police were gone then someone smarter or more ruthless would take it away from them again—that he has got to earn that equality.
He has got to—to learn as everybody must that—that liberty and freedom—is noondition like rainfall or sunshine or being too cold or being too hot.
That'ondition that one must—must work to gain and then work to hold that—that to keep equality and freedom you must learn the responsibility of equality and freedom that nobody can have the freedom given him by the police until he's willing to—to deserve it and then work to keep it which is to be responsible for it.
Ano hope that—that some people in the Negro race read it and believed in it and—and will take heed to it since it'roblem which has got to be solved as we—we can't—can't deport the whole Negro race.
He'art of our country now and—and we must all the white man and the Negro too must work together to—to make his condition bearable.
Otherwise it's—it's like having seventeen million mules running loose in the country.
Yes ma'am.It seems you have placed the Negro in an inferior position ...ave not placed him in an inferior position.
It's the—the—the whole white race and white economy has placed him in an inferior position economically and educationally because in—in that position the—the white man's revenues from his economy will bittle higher.
It's not that the Negro—we don't know whether the Negro is inferior to the white man or not.
He's had no chance to be anything else.
But I—aee it he must have—have the chance to prove whether he is inferior or not that he is not going to be content any longer to be inferiorean artificially inferior.
He's got to have the chance to prove that he is equalor incapable of it.
And it's better to—for the white man to give him that chance than to have that chance foisted on the white man by law.
the state of the Negro was forced upon him by law was it notWell siould say by custom and then of course all our law is—is or usually is—it speaks after the fact.
The law simply makes legal what has beeustom.
The law don't change ...  ... the—and from—from Greece from Olympus in it somewhere.
It lasts just foay or two then it's gone but every year in August that occurs in our country and that's all that title meant.
It was just—to me a—a pleasant evocative title because it—it reminded me of—of that time ouminosity older than our Christian civilization.
Maybe the connection was with Lena Grove who had something of that pagan quality of—of being able to—to assume everything the desire for—for that child.
She was never ashamed of that child whether it had any father or not.
She was simply going to follow the conventional laws of the time in which she was and find its father.
But as far as she was concerned she didn't especially need the father for it any more than the—than the women that—on whom Jupiter begot children were anxious foome anather.
It was enough to have had the child.
And that was all that meant just that luminous lambent quality of an older light than ours.Is ""Rose for Emily" all fictiones sir.
Yes sir that's—that's all fiction for the reasoaid too.
If any timriter writes anything that—that seems at all familiar to anybody anywhere he getetter about it and if they think he got enough money he's sued too so he's awful careful  not to write anything he ever saw himself or anybody ever told him.
we're all very grateful to you for coming this afternoonant to thank you so much.
Thank you.
Blotner Fohile Dublin had James Joyce.
Fohile Lübech had Thomas Mann.
Fohile happily Charlottesville has hand as Dublin and Lübech were home to Joyce and Mann so we hope thaill regard Charlottesville aind of second home.
In adding up some year's end statistics we found thaad met on twenty-four different occasions with undergraduate and graduate classes with university organizations and with groups such as this one today.
These audiences totaled more than fifteen hundred people.
In his office on the fifth floor of Cabell Hall he has held office hours two houray six dayeek throughout the semester.
Besides being the most punctual and faithful man in the department in keeping office hours he has we estimate counseled more than one hundred and fifty University of Virginia students.
Speaking of the University and its students some time ago  Jefferson said "I hope its influence on their virtue freedom fame and happiness will be salutary and permanent."
We think this is an accurate description of the servicas performed.
It has been some time since one could say oovel that it was both on the best-seller list and also the work oobel-Prize winner.
One can say this of The Town and it is from this novel thaill read briefly this afternoon.
Then he will answer any questions you care to put to him.
Around the turn of the century opera impresarios used to arrange very extended farewell tours for some of their stars.
During the past few weeks both Time Magazine and some newspapers have reported  's last appearances but now for positively the last time this season pplause  This interminable valedictory does seem to be coming to an end at lastave tried to express to  Gwynn and  Blotner how much pleasurave had hereould like to say to the people of Charlottesville too how much pleasure this has been for me.
It's been so much pleasure thaittle concerned about whether it could have done any good or not that anything this much fun must be bad someway.
There iidge; you drive on beyond Seminary Hill and in time you come upon iild unhurried farm road presently mounting to cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from Jefferson to the world.
And now looking back and down you see all Yoknapatawpha in the dying last of day beneath you.
There are stars now just pricking out as you watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning; the end of day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith.
Yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth drained from earth backward and upward into that cooling green but rather had gathered pooling for an unmoving moment yet among the low places of the ground so that ground earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are dark standing dark and immobile out of it.
Then as though at signal the fireflies—lightning-bugs of the Mississippi child's vernacular—myriad and frenetic random and frantic pulsing; not questing not quiring but choiring as if they were tiny incessant appeaseless voices cries words.
And you stand suzerain and solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath that incessant ephemeral spangling.
First is Jefferson the center radiating weakly its puny glow into space; beyond it enclosing it spreads the County tied by the diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hub by its spokes yourself detached as God Himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and women who made you the record and chronicle of your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past; you to preside unanguished and immune above this miniature of man's passions and hopes and disasters—ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation and pity and honor and sin and pride all bound precarious and ramshackle held together by the web the iron-thin warp and woof of his rapacity but withal yet dedicated to his dreams.
They are all here supine beneath you stratified and superposed osseous and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms—the rich alluvial river-bottom land of old Issetibbeha the wild Chickasaw king with his Negro slaves and his sister's son called Doom who murdered his way to the throne and legend said (record itself said since there were old men in the county in my childhood who had actually seen it) stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert intalace proper to aggrandise his state; the same fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether we—I mean of course they—ever actually ownelantation or not Sutpen and Sartoris and Compson and Edmonds and McCaslin and Beauchamp and Grenier and Habersham and Holston and Stevens and De Spain generals and governors and judges soldiers (even if only Cuban lieutenants) and statesmen failed or not and simple politicians and over-reachers and just simple failures who snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished name face and all.
Then the roadless almost pathless perpendicular hill-country of McCallum and Gowrie and Frazier and Muir translated intact with their pot stills and still peaking only—speaking only the old Gaelic and not much of that from Culloden to Carolina then from Carolina to Yokpatawpha still intact and still speaking not much of anything except that they now called the pots "kettles" though the drink (evean remember this) was still usquebaugh; then and last on to where Frenchman's Bend lay beyond the south—southeastern horizon cradle of Varners and ant-heap of the northeast crawl of Snopes.
And you stand there—you the old man already white-headed (because it doesn't matter if they call your gray hairs premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and anguishes) and pushing forty onlew years from forty—while there rises up to you proffered up to you the spring darkness the unsleeping darkness which although it is of the dark itself declines the dark since dark is of the little death called sleeping.
Because look how even though the last of west is no longer green and all of firmament is now one unlidded studded slow-wheeling arc and the last of earth-pooled visibility has drained away there still remains one faint diffusion since everywhere you look about the dark panorama you can still see them faint as whispers the faint and shapeless lambence of dogwood blooming return loaned light to light as the phantoms of candles would.
And you the old man standing there while there rises to you about you suffocating you the spring dark peopled and myriad two and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy the privacy decreed and created for them by the spring darkness the spring weather the spring which an—which an American poeine onoman and so she knows called girls' weather and boys' luck.
Which was not the first day at all not Eden morning at all because girls' weather and boys' luck is the sum of all the days the cup the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no more; proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even that sometimes premature too soon.
Because the tragedy of life is it must be premature inconclusive and inconcludable in order to be life; it must be before itself in advance of itself to have been at all Yes ma'am.In—in this book The Town we come across so many of the characters we have met previously.
Are those four snaky Snopeses newre the what Snopes new?
The four snaky Snopeses in the last chapterot to mehought of—of—of these people thirty years ago and—and the morhought about them the more Snopes they invented.
It's simply thaaven't got around yet to—to telling about them.
There's one more volume whicope will be the last buave no assurance that it will be.
It may be that wheinish that there will still be another.
But they are—are not new to me.
They have been in—been alive and have been in motionave hated them and laughed at them and been afraid of them for thirty years now.
Fascinatingwho's that poetess quoted in the passage you just readhat was Djuna Barnes.
She belonged to one of the first minute precious expatriate groups back in the—when was thathe Twenties wasn't itwenties.
Yes the early Twenties.
Djuna Barnes it wason't know whether she's still alive or not.
Do you know?
Yes ma'am.Who will inherit Jefferson if and when the Snoopses or Snopeses are ever exterminatedelelieve that—that man can cope with all his follieshink that—that the fact that Snopeses can flourish is jusymptom of man's folly but that man copes with it that he will—will rid himself of—of even the Snopeses by some desire for simple decency.
Maybe it's just in order to get along with—with his fellow men and women in Jefferson but he will cope with Snopeses and—and what is good in our country will—will still endure.
It may take a—a—a different phase from what our—our ancestors knew it before 1861 buhink that even Snopeses can be coped with and even hydrogen bombs can be coped with.
Yes sir.Sir you dabbled in poetrittle bit before you began writing.
Did you ever have any published at all or—  One book.
I'ailed poettill think of myself aailed poetelieve that any writer wants first to boetry—a poet.
When he finds that he can't write first-rate poetry and poetry of all must be first-rate.
There are no degrees of it.
It's either first-rate or it's bad.
It's rotten.
Then he tries short stories which is the next severe medium.
When that fails then he goes to the novel.
That is he wants first to take—take the tragedy and passion of—of experience of life and put it into fourteen words.
If he can't he tries two thousand words.
If he fails that then he takeundred thousand.
Yes ma'am.Where do plays work with that categoryhe play partakes oittle of all.
That is a—a—a special—specialized medium almost.
It—it must—to be good it must partake of—of all three of the poetry of the short story and the—the novel but certainly it's—it's above the novel because it don't take quite as many words.
Thaood playwright don't have to talk as long aovelist has to talk to tell his storyI read in Coughlan's book that "The Phoenix and the Turtle" is your favorite poem.
Is that true and if so is there any special reasonsoubt if anyone haavorite poem unless it's somebody that haavorite poem by Edgar A.
Guest that's good for visitors  and Ion't think anyone could havavorite poem.
It depends on—on how you feel what you like to read and remember of something that you have seen or run into that—that makes you think of truth as some poet has expressed it Yes sir.Iable was there any definite attempt on your part to more or less put it in biblical languagehat was the only boover wrote from an idea and san't say myself just how much of the intent was deliberate to follow the story of the Passion Week oattern of—of any Christian legend or even the language of the Bible though I'm—I'm quite sure that the—that the deliberate intent was there but how much I—I can't say becaushink the writer when he is busy telling his story he hasn't really got time to think about style or—or about the pattern of—of his—his sentences.
He's too busy.
But anyone writing writes from his own experience his own observations his own imagination and all he has read iart of his experience and so in the—the heat and fury of—of composing his piece he will reach back into his memory and he will dig up all sorts of things and will fit them into the joint just as the carpenter does witoard until he finds the one that—that makes the best joint or makes the—the soundest corner or the driest roof and shink that no man can say just how much of—otylethod is deliberately deliberate or unconsciously deliberate or what.
In fact he's so busy trying to tell his story that he don't really care.Do you do much rewriting No more thaan help.
I'm lazy and I'd heap rather think otory and—and laugh over it myself than to go to the trouble to put it down on the paperut that off as long as possible.
Then when it worries me so mucan't put it off anymore theut it down anry to be sure that it's right son't to have to rewrite it though sometimes it's—it's wrong ano have to.Well how are your—are your characters created out of your own imagination or are they taken from people you've knownny writer is completely amoral.
Any artist is.
He takes what he thinks he will need from any source with no compunction and with no sense of being amoral or unmoral because anyone after him is perfectly at liberty to take anything from him they want.
Alsoubt if any writer would be satisfied with—with men and women just the way the Lord makes them.
He's convinced he can makuch better job than that.
And any fiction writer iongenital liar to begin with and he probably couldn't tell the truth about anything that no matter what he tried to tell the truth about he would embroider jusittle Yes ma'am.After you have written your book and maybe read it over two or three years later do you find symbolism in it that you didn't realize at the time you were writing it?
Do you find—you ever find more in it than you realized at the time you were writing it doubt iriter ever reads his—his book again.
audience laughtehink that—that—that's one saving thing he has in his craft that every time he writeook he knows that's one book he won't have to read.
Also the reason that the writer writes another book is that one that he finished wasn't quite good enough to suit him and he don't want to read that book anymore.
He wants to forget that book because he's trying to write the next one which may be good enough.
Of course he knows that one probably won't be good enough too but that's what keeps him going.
That's why taken by and large his life is so happy.
He has something to wake up tomorrow morning to—to need to do not to want to do but to need to do that drives him to do it.
But it's never quite good enough for him so he doesn't need to read it again.
He's not interested in what anybody else thinks about it because he himself knows it ain't good enough for him and that's the only opinion he really cares about Yes ma'am.You often have referred to male authors that you have enjoyed.
Are there are any women writers you esteemes any number.
Brontё or Willa Cather Ellen Glasgow—any numberhink that—that wheefer to—to authors as males I'm simply using "he" as—as sort of a—a—a simplified term to express an individual.
Yes any number of—of good ones.Was Wuthering Heights one of your favorite books?
I—I remember you gave uist and I—I don't remember them all.on't really have favorite booksave books thaead many times over and over but it's not for the book it's for the people in it.
There're certain people thaike to read about just as you like to go intoom and spend thirty minutes with an old friend and Wuthering Heights iook thaave—have admired for its craftsmanship but—but there's—there's nothing in it thaould ever—ever read again probably though some daight Yes ma'am.When an idea germinates fotory do you start with the story or the situation or with the characterertain character that interests youometimes it'ituation an anecdote or—oicture.
Usually it'haracter.Usually it'haracternd the character takes charge of the—of the whole thing and begins to invent his supporting cast and—and then they all go charging away at full speed and tell the story and alo is just to run along behind them and put it down.
But they take charge of it.
It's—it's usuallharacter though occasionally an anecdote of something a—a picturental image that has—has to do with—with something of the human conditionrote one book from—from the mental picture oittle girl climbinree to look iorbidden parlor window.
She'd fallen down in the mud oainy afternoon and the image was the—the muddy seat of—of that child about twelve or thirteen years old the muddy seat of her drawers  and that wahink the—what the book came from.
did you start writing—now you probably answered this questioillion times—but did you start writing aefinite period of your life or have you always written more or less since the time you were a—a little boy imagine thaad—had been scribbling as soon aearned to spell.
I've told this story before.
If anyone has heard iope they will excuse it this time.
That was as soon aearned to spell and I'd always liked to imagine stories and occasionally put something down buas still—had not taken it seriously untias in New Orleansas working foootlegger.
This was back in the—in the twenties anet Sherwood Anderson and we liked each other right away.
We would meet in the afternoon.
We would walk around the French Quarter along the docks and he would talk anould listen.
We'd meet again in the evening.
We'd go to a—a nice patio or courtyard and we'd sit oveottle of whiskey and he would talk anould listen.
In the morninouldn't see him.
He'd be in seclusion working.
And that would go on day after day the afternoons to walk and laugh and talk and the evenings to—to drink and laugh and talk in the mornings in seclusion working.
Anhought that if that was all it took to briter that was exactly the life for me.
So I—I starteook and right awaound that it was fun thaiked it anot so interested in iorgot about  Andersonadn't seen him for several weeks anenderson on the street.
She said "What's wrong?
Are you mad at us?
We haven't seen you iong time.aid "No ma'am.
I'm writing book."
She said "Good God."
I—I met heeek or two after and she asked about the bookaias just about to finish it.
She said "Do you want Sherwood to read it hadn't thought of anybody reading itaid "Well'm he can if wants to."
She said "Well Sherwood says he'll makwap with you.
If he don't have to read that book he'll tell his publisher to take it."
Said "Done"  and he told his publisher to take the book and that's hoecame—took up writing seriously.
Up to that time I'd done it—well it never occurred to me that anybody might want to read it or hadn't thought of it in public terms till then.But if you hadn't met Sherwood Anderson it would have been inevitable though.
Oh yes.
Yes indeedhink the writer is driven bemon that he can't help himself anymore.
That'ice really.
Nothing he can do about it.
And he just wastes time fighting it.
Best thing is to go on and briter.
Yes sir.Whaould you give as your definition of poetryt's some moving passionate moment of the human condition distilled to its absolute essence.
Yes sir.This irobabluestion you've been asked many times also.
Why have you—or have you ever been tempted to do play-writingo probably becausave spent all my life in the country anan count on my thumbs almost the plays I've seen.
Anave never thought in terms of—of—of theater.
It may be it takes a—a—a special temperament to do it buave never—never thought in terms of theater.
I'm sure the main reason is that I've never seen enough of it that I—I like to read plays.
I'd much rather read one than see one.Considering the Sherwood Anderson connection had he written Winesburg Ohio when you met himes.
Yes he was working on—on Dark Laughter then.
He—that was after Winesburg and after The Triumph of the Egg.
His two beshink.Well his best character seems to have been George Willard and isn't iit tragic that he left him in Winesburg and never revived him don't think so.
That George Willard is alive enough.
There's no need to—to harass and worry the man to death.
He has come alive and as—as you say he's the best character.
That's enough.
Yes ma'am.Since your characters for instance sometimes come from your reading and your experiences you must have occurrences of unconscious plagiarism or at least fears that you have read it somewhere before.
How do you cope with sucituationell aaid any writer is completely amoral that he has very likely stolen it from somewhere but then he has no qualms about that because anyone after him that steals from him flatters him and he assumes that every other writer feels that way.
There are so few things to write about and the—the human condition changes so slowly that very likely almost any situation except foew minor differences has already been written about by somebody and very likely you read it somewhere.
That reading to me is part of one's experience as much of one's experience as—as dealing with actual flesh—fresh—flesh and blood people but there's—I'm sure that any writer is ready to admit that he has stolen from everything he ever read and he has read everything from the telephone book up and down.
Yes sir.
you have been called among other thinghristian humanistas wondering if you could tell me what you consider your relationship to the Christian religionhy the Christian religion has never harmed me anopever have harmed it.
audience laughteave the—the sort of—of provincial Christian background which one takes for granted without thinking too much about it probably.
That I'm—probably within my own lighteel that I'm a—a good Christian.
Whether it would please anybody else's standard or noon't know.Do you know where your story is going when you start workingThe end when you startnly—only twice havnown where the story was going.
Once was in—in Fable.
The other was iook called Aay Dying.
They were both tour de force snew where they were going.
The otheron't know where they're goingimply try to keep up with the people who have already gotten in motion to put down what they do and say and then havittle time afterward to throw away the trash but I—that—that's probably true with—with most writers unless they do write from a—from a—a synopsis that they don't know where the story's going.
Some writers can work that way and the indecision is eliminated.
That is that first draft that first synopsis may have taken—taken care of the—of the—the confusion which my method follows about where the thing is going.Do you havynopsis or do you—  No'm I—I never havynopsis anever have made any research and don't keep notes because ias going to go to the trouble to keep notes I'd try to write it sould print it.
It's too much troubleon't like to write that much.
did you study or havormal writing classes ... college didn't go to collegeidn't like school and quit in the sixth grade.
I'm the oldest living sixth grader.
audience laughtehinearned to write in the only possible way that there is to learn to write which is to read and to read and to read and to try it and to try it and to try it until it—until it suits you which of course it won't do.
But to try and to try and to try but reading is—is the way to learn to writeoubt if anyone can be taught anything anyhow buon't believe anyone can be taught to write.
You've got to be demon-driven and to want to learn in spite of everything Yes ma'am.You say you follow your characters witotebook and recall what they do and say.
You do not plan any of the conversationso'on't.Or any of the incidentso.You're not responsible for anything they doo ma'am.
I'm not responsible for anything they do or say.
Any ideas they express are theirs and not mine.
Iave the same idea it's purely coincidental.
do you find that you can write almost anywhere orain or riding in the back seat oar?
Or in an officeh yes.
Sure just anywhereut it off as long aan.
Then whean't put off any longean write anywhere on anything and with anything excepypewriter.
I'm not much good witypewriter Yes sir.Have you picked up anything interesting whether ideas or people during your stay in Charlottesville?
That comes back to the—to the writer's complete amorality that he don't have to say now let's see if there's anything in this alley thaan use.
He just picks it up whether he can use it or not  and later on he finds that maybe he can but he don't—he's—Calls fohenomenal memory thenell it's—it'henomenal memory in the sense that—that the muscle remembers that it's not anything that—that's really catalogued into the mind.
It's catalogued into whatever muscles of the human spirit produce the—the book or the music or the picture and we'll assume that—that there are muscles in the spirit that do that.
The—the—the artist is—well it'ittle more than kleptomania it'ittle of kleptomania.
But—rather more of—of whatever it is that makes the magpie pick up everything or the packrat pick up anything that's loosehink that's the way the writer goes through life through books and through the actual living world too.
That he misses very little not because he's made up his mind before breakfast not to miss anything today but because those muscles do it for him and when the need comes he digs out things that he didn't know where he saw them which to him don't matter.
He may have stolen it—he probably did—but to him that's not important.
The important thing is if he uses it worthily.
If he makes some base use of it then of course it'hame.
But he wants to—when he steals he wants—he wants the owner that he stole from to approve of what he did with it or not to disapprove too much.
... happen among people and if anything can happen to—to improve man's condition and get rid of his bother and trouble it will be for amateur to meet amateur not for professional to meet professional but for amateur to meet amateur and io have the amateur quality that people in Charlottesville have—have—have felt and been in sympathy with then—then my time here has been more than just happy it's been worthwhile toomagine that—that there could be circles conditions in which the Writer-In-Residence would have to biterary man but—but I'm noiterary man and—and I'm happy to know that—that in Charlottesville at least I've been forgiven for that.
Yes sir.How much of yourself do you include in your characters?
Welonsider that I'm in the public domain just like you and  Gwynn and anybody else thaeet but I'm still convinced thaan makuch better job of  than God made of  sill—iere writing my own biography very likelouldn't possibly tell the truth about it.
Actually the writer has got to write from experience observation imagination and—and imagination and observation are bound to be colored jusittle by experience so actually any artist is simply recounting time after time his own biography or his own history or his own reaction to the human condition which is—which is universal to all men.
But his is a—what he thinks iarticular ache and anguish which to him anyway is important enough to put into the music or the picture or into the poem.
But he must write from what he knows and all he knows is jusittle of himself because he will die not knowing too much about himself but he would certainly know very little about anything else.
Yes ma'am.Your demon sounds relentless.
Is there any hope for anyone learning to write if they havart-time demon?
Welhink that—that there's a—a limitless supply of demons just like germs that hang around maybe just looking for lodgment in anyone that shows any aptitude for ink.
That it's—that's—aaid it'ice and it'irulent sort of vice too.
If you ain't careful it'll get you Yes ma'am.You've often talked about the effort to convey condition of man do you think that this can be achieved in comedyh yes certainly because so much of man's condition is comedy.
It's difficult to say just where comedy stops and tragedy begins.
His condition is his eternal struggle with himself with his fellows and with his environment and that takes the form of—of—of comic or tragic situations and the comic situations show the tragedy of his—his constant indomitable striving with his own heart the heart of mankind or the condition in which mankind has to function so one is just as valid as the other just as important and who can say just where one stops and the other startssn't it rather unusual foan to write his first book setting in full-blown and starting that way rather than an outline maybirst chapter—a whole book for the first time.
Is that what's usually doneell it's probablittle unusual for a—a reasonably prospering young bootlegger to meeriter like Sherwood Anderson.
That don't happen to everybody you know.
how old were you thenwenty-two twenty-three.
That was in the early '20s after the old war.Did he advise you on your writing?
Did he criticize youo'm he wouldn't even read it.
That was the trade he made.
He would never read it.
Did he talk about writing to you at all about your worko'm we talked about people.
Rather he talked anistened.
He was telling me the fantastic stories which later he would probably write buouldn't believe any of it  becausnew he wariter.
He talked anistened but it was not about books because neither one of us were literary people because we were not really interested in literature and books.
We were interested in people and the comic and tragic ephemera of man's condition interested in laughing maybe.
do you feel thariter might be hampered bollege education?
Keep him from creating the characters ...—  No sio nothink thaollege education is not going to hamper anyonehink thaot of people are subject to it that don't deserve it and can do nothing with it but it's not going to hamper anyonehink that—that the college education will save the writereat deal of—of—of trouble which he would have to go to in simply learning about man about the—the history the record the history of man that is available to him in the university which otherwise he has got to get out and dig for himself and I'm sorry thaidn't have a—a college education myselfhink that if you have the demon you're going to—to write anyway.
Nothing is going to stop you and it may be you don't want things too easy.
Buever heard of anyone that was hurt bollege education and any writer that says "I would have beeood writer except"—I put no stock in that becauselieve that the "mute inglorious Milton" iomplete myth.
in spite of what happens to General Compson and Colonel Sutpen and Colonel Sartoris there seems to beroic quality about them.
Do you think that it is still possible for that kind of heroism in the time of which the story in The Town is setehink that—that although man is not always matched with his finest hour I'm convinced that—that the hour the need finds the men it—it requires.
That the men like—like Compson and Sutpen who—who had the—the desire to—to be heroic they failed through—through lack of character or absence of things in their character which should not have been there but at least they tried.
But I'm convinced that the hour will find the men it needs.
Though the tragedy is the man who didn't find his hour didn't find his chance to—to be what he could have been and might have been.
He's tragic Yes ma'am.What effect if any have the opinions of literary critics had on your writingoneon't read criticsmagine that most writers don't.
They're too busy.
That is the book the writer just finished ain't good enough.
He knows that before he's finished it and so he's forgot about that book.
He's going to try one next that will be and so since it—it didn't meet with his approval he don't care what anybody else's opinion of it is.
And in my own casike to read buin't going to read what anybody thinks about somebody else's ideas.
I'd rather read about people.Have you ever received any rejection slips  Yes'm for the first few years when I'd try to write short storieot plenty of rejection slips.How did it affect you?
Or did itelould—I would be frustrated and—and enraged in the time wheopeould geittle money for it but iidn't need money at that time it didn't make much differenceent it somewhere else or—oas busy still writing another one.
I'd probably—that's—I've heard it's haery depressive affect on many writers.
It—it could ooung writer yeshink that—that the young writer maybe doesn't always know or doesn't always have time to decide exactly why he writes.
Under the pressure of—of our—our culture the only measure for his writing is whether people buy it whether it's in the magazines or not and he accepts that and it gives hiot of bother and trouble until he gets alonittle and realizes that's not at all why one writes that the reason one writes is from the full knowledge of death that we all have.
He knows that some day he will pass into oblivion.
He has seen something so—so moving so beautiful so aching in the human condition that he wants to write about it and what he is—is actually doing is to makcratch on that wall.
Before he passes through the last wall into nothingness he will leave on that wall "Kilroy was here."
Not for glory not for money just to say "I was here foittle whileid thisade something that wasn't here before."
That's probably the reason he sticks at it why he's not discouraged bejection slip.
what became of those stories that were rejected in the first few years you were writing?
Did you just abandon themept themept them and aftehile the folks that rejected them bought them.
They bought them.
audience laughte   Yes sir.
This demon that follows you could it be described as one that insists on your writinertain story one story or is it one that suggests lots of different stories and you'll have to use your rational mind and selecto it's the sort of demon that is like the mosquito that won't let you sleep.
You want to say "Oh go away let's—let's be quiehile.
What's the use in going to all this bother and trouble just to write books and storiesut it won't let you sleep.
It's not that it says "You must tell this story."
It's just that it won't let you alone.
That it keeps on whispering to you "If you wake up this iot of fun.
Come on.
Wake up and try it now.
"The demon doesn't really care which story you write then—  No'hink it's just against repose more than in favor of anything.Do you see any faces as you describe characters?
Do you sehysical person as you writees yeon't always heaame bulways see a—a physical facody mannerisms and quite often they name themselves but not always.So where did you get your nameshe—the characters usually name themselves or the situation names the characters.
I've never had to hunt around and say "Now let's see what shalall Smith this timehat he has said "This is whm and this is what I'm going to be called.
"Have you usually known people with these namesry not to usame I've ever heard because once you do it two days later you geetter saying "Dear Siave just turned this matter over to my lawyer.
How much money do you have?
"— And so any writer is awful careful not to put down any name he ever heard or—or to describe any incident he ever actually saw.ead that you admired  Wolfe—Thomas Wolfe's work very much.
Just what about it what—what do you admire about his workow that was an unfortunate remarade.
It waroup of students.
They asked me whahought about my contemporariesaid "It's too soon to say.
We're not done writing."
This was oh twenty—twenty thirty years ago.
They said "Well don't you have any opinion of them at all said "Opinion of whoe named Wolfe Caldwell Hemingway Dos Passos.
Anaid "Welhink we all failed so I'll have to rate us on whaonsider the splendor of our failure and so this is the waould rate us" and ever since that I've been trying to explain that or live it down.
But that's all it was.
To tell the trutaven't read much of Wolfe.
I've read one or two of his stories.
I've opened his books and read pages or paragraphs but that was—was an opinion on the—the tremendous effort that he had gone into to try to put all of—of the history of the human heart on the head of the pin.
That is to tell it all in each paragraph until he died as though he had a—a premonition of his own early death.
That was whaeant by—by the failure.
That he failed the best because he had tried the hardest he had—had taken the longest gambles taken the longest shotsated Hemingway last not on the value of—of the product at all but simply because of—of Hemingway having taught himselatterethod which he could use and he stuck to that without splashing around to try to experiment.
It had nothing to do with the value of the work at all.
It was simply on the degree of the—of the attempt to reach the unattainable dream to—to accomplish more than any flesh and blood man could accomplish could touch.nderstand that in writing The Sound and the Fury you meant for the first part Benjy's story to be the book and then you went then on afterwards to add three more parts.
What prompted you to do that?
Did you feel the need to go on and explain ...
It was to bhort story.
It was those three children who had been forbidden to come into the house that afternoon for what reason they didn't know.
They only knew dimly that—that grandmama had been sick and they didn't know that they'd been forbidden to come in the house because of the funeral and they were curious enough to climb up to see why they couldn't go into the parlor that they had been forbidden to enterhought it would bhort story of ten pages maybe.
It got longer and longer and theegan to know more and more about the people in it aninished the first section and that wasn't right.
Srote another sectionet somebody else try it.
That wasn't rightet another brother try it.
That still wasn't rightried it once myself and that still wasn't right.
It still is not—not good enough to suit me.
It's still not the book that I'm convinced iadn't written it and could start again tomorroould write it better.
Probably wouldn't but I'm convinced of that.Sires sir.I'd like to ask you about two incidents in The Sound and the Fury whicidn't—I didn't—I wasn't able to—to relate to the rest of the story buhought they were—the fact that you threw them in was interesting.
And one was—welaven't read this fohile and you—you say you haven't either.
One was about something to do with—witroken leg aecall.
And another waescription of an operation which took place in the woods aemember witazor blade.
And I'd like for you to—to try to help me understand just how these fit in with the rest of the book and what they had to do with the story as you recall.on't remember about the operation with the razor blade in the woods though without doubt it—it referred to—to—to the castration of the idiot child.
After he had tried to molesittle girl they had to do something about him so he was castrated and if the operation in the woods had any application anan't remember now it was probably something out of the older brother's garbled half-mad history and background which he had used as a—as a—aransference.
The—the brutality of it aransference onto this shameful thing which—which his idiot brother had had to suffer.
The—the broken bone—I don't remember—but I'm—I'm—I worked so hard at that book thaoubt if there's anything in it that—that didn't belong thereould have to look at the book again to—  That's Aay Dying isn't it?
Cash's broken legh well yes that was to—to show the—the—the ignorance of these people in trying to repair that—that broken bone with cement in order to make this completely foolish hegira with that decaying body which they were doing which was in its own way heroic because they had promised that woman that they would take her back to—to her people to bury her and so they went through fire and flood and all possible natural catastrophes to—to do this thing which didn't need to be done at all but they had promised to do it so they did.Sir did—when you wrote either The Sound and the Fury and—or Aay Dying did you—were you conscious of—of making the characters the brothers and sisters and their relationships somewhat similar?ean would you think back as you—as you recall—that it seems to me that there'ertain type of family relationship in each of the families which—I wouldn't—I don't know which one of the books you wrote first—  Well yes probably there is due to the fact that in each one of them there waister surrounded by a—a gang of brothers.
The one Aay Dying was tour de forcenew wheut down the first word what the last word of that would be.
The other was anything but tour de forceas completely submerged in the other one.
I—I struggled and anguished with it foear.
This is—Aay Dyinrote in about six weeks without changing any of it.
If there is any relationship it's probably simply because both of them happened to—to havister in a—a roaring gang of men folks.
you spoke about The Sound and the Fury as starting out to writhort story and it kept growing.
Well now do you think that it's easier to writovel thahort storyes sir you can be more careless.
You can put more trash in it and be excused for it thahort story—that's next to the poem.
Almost every word has got to be almost exactly right.
In the novel you can be careless but in the short story you can'tean by that the good short stories like Chekhov wrote.
That's whate that second—it's because it's—it demandearer absolute exactitude.
You have less room to be slovenly and careless.
There's less room in it for trash.
In poetry of course there's no room at all for trash.
It's got to be absolutely impeccable absolutely perfect.It's more like playwriting thenes'm that's right....  That's right.
That's right.
Of course playwriting has one more demand that you're—you're not going to keep your audience that long.
Witook you can read thahile and put it down and then go back and read it but if it'lay you can't.
If you don't use up your ticket tonight you've got to buy another ticket.
Yes sir.
would you care—I—I think you've made us understand your feeling thariter is never satisfied with his work but would you care to suggest which one of your works or one or two of your works that you consider—that are your own favoritesell that goes back to—to the old standard of failure.
The one that's the dearest to me is the one that—that caused me the most anguish and trouble just like the—the idiot child is—is the—the dearest to the—to the parent and that's The Sound and the Fury.
That's the onorked at the hardest made the most splendid and to me the most beautiful failure so that's the one thaove.
The others didn't cause that much trouble.
That is I—I—I found out sooner thaouldn't make them perfect and was willing to quit.
With The Sound and the Fury it took mong time to realizouldn't make it good enough to suit me before I'd give it up.
Yes ma'am.Do you like to read modern works and if so how do you choose the ones that you like to read think most writers as they get old read less and less annow thaead now the books thanew and loved wheaoung manaven't read a—a dozen contemporary books in the last dozen years and they were books which someone gave me and said "Read thihink you will like it" or "There's something interesting in it" then I'll read it.
But the reasoo is—is in the old books whico back to as you go to call on an old friend and talk with him fohile.
do you feel that your war experiences in World Waad any significant influence on the perspective of the South that you developed in Yoknapatawpha County don't know.
Aaid the writer uses every experience that ever happened to him and he is not interested in just how much one experience changes his own point of view that he is too involved and too engaged with the people that he thinks he is writing about that he hopes to make come alive and stand up in three dimensions and cashadow behind them that he himself can't say because he don't really care how much any of his own private experience has changed him that he's going to use it all that he stores everything away willy-nilly regardless just as—as the magpie picks up everything that glitters or as the professional carpenter don't ever throw awalank no matter how crooked or short it is that some day he will use it.Caave one other question in that general area?
Do you see or have you seen in the South an analogy between the Civil War and the First World War as you knew ito I—I don'tmagine that—that literary experts or maybe even war literary experts might find analogiesyself don't recall any.
Alemember about the—the only wanow about was that was the first war when if you were scared you said so.
Up to that time nobody every admitted he was scared.
There may have—there waot of romantic foolishness talked about air fighting in that war which wasn't really there because you were still contending witachine which would come to pieces or would burn up that there was nothing of the—of the quality of matching your—your own skill against another human being with the same fine high hopes and desires that you had.
You were involved witonfounded machine that would kill you.
we're very grateful to you for being with us and we thank you very much.
Well thank you all.
audience Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
On behalf of the Jefferson Society Omicron Delta Kappa and the Raven Societelcome you tonight to what we consider a—a rare honor anrivilege.
At this timould like to turn the meeting over tentleman whon't believe could be any—could have been any more aptly choseentleman who iember of the Jefferson Society and at one time served as her president who iember of Omicron Delta Kappa—Kappember in longstanding of the Raven Society anolder of the Raven Award Dean of the Law School Dean Ribble.
Ladies and gentlemehall not introduce our distinguished speaker who happily has beeember of our community foear and halfould like to just saord of thanks to the three ancient and honorable organizations which have planned this meeting for us.
They're all very old.
As we say in law so old that memory—the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.
The oldeselieve is the Jefferson Society.
It started in 1825 and had as one of its first members Edgar Allan Poe so you see their interest in men of letters is quite old.
The other two have equally and greatly added to the life of this University and the three of them are adding to their fame and to our debt of gratitude to them by presenting to us tonighentlemen who ireat Americareat southerner and one whom we're very proud to have aember of our universitypplause  With Dean Ribble's permissioould like to elaborate thaittle more.
With Professor Stovall's blessings  Gwynn and  Blotner have agreed that my tenure as writer-in-residence here might bittle better if we kept it informal serious but not too concentrated and continuous.
That is when I'm on the fifth floor of Cabell Hall I'm writer-in-residence.
When I'm not there then I'm jusississippi citizen that likes and admires Virginia and Virginia peopleope that—that now you will take me under those conditions that I'm jusrivate citizen here that likes and admires Virginia Virginia people even when they may not like what I'm going to say.
That is as far as the University is concernem free home here and as far as you're concernem free game.
Only do flush me first.
Don't shoot me sitting.
audience laughtehairman members of the Jefferson Society the Raven Society ODK and ladies and gentlemeundred years ago Abraham Lincoln said "This nation cannot endure half slave and half free."
If he were alive today he would amend it "This nation cannot endure containininority as large as ten percent held second class in citizenship by the accident of physical appearance."
Aesser man might put it this nor any country or community of people can no more get along in peace with ten percent of its population arbitrarily unassimilated thaown of five thousand people can get along in peace with five hundred unbridled horses loose in the streets or saommunity of five thousand cats with five hundred unassimilated dogs among them or vice versa.
For peaceful coexistence all must be one thing—either all first-class citizens or all second-class citizens either all people or all horses either all cats or all dogs.
Perhaps the Negro is not yet capable of more than second-class citizenship.
His tragedy may be that so far he is competent for equality only in the ratio of his white blood.
But even if that is so the problem of the second-class citizens still remains.
It would not solve the problem even if the Negro were himself content to remain onlecond-class citizen even though relieved of his first-class responsibilities by his classification.
The fact would still remain that we aration established on the fact that we are only ninety percent unified in power.
With only ninety percent of unanimity we would face and hope to survive in it an inimical world unified against us even if only in inimicality.
We cannot be even ninety percent unified against that inimical world which outnumbers us because too much of even that ninety percent of power is spent and consumed by the physical problem of the ten percent of irresponsibles.
It is easy enough for the North to blame on us the South the fact this problem is still unsolved.
Ierortherner that's whaould do tell myself that one hundred years ago we—both of us North and South—had put this to the test and had solved it.
That it is not us the North but you the South who have refused to accept that verdict.
Nor will it help us any to remind the North that by ratio of Negro to white in population there's probably more of inequality and injustice there than with us.
Instead we should accept that gambit.
Let us say to the North "All right it is our problem and we will solve it."
For the sake of the argument let us agree that as yet the Negro is incapable of equality for the reason that he could not hold and keep it even if were forced on him with bayonets that once the bayonets were removed the first smart and ruthless man black or white who came along would take it away from him because he the Negro is not yet capable of or refuses to accept the responsibilities of equality.
So we the white man must take him in hand and teach him that responsibility.
This will not be the first time nor the last time in the long record of man's history that moral principle has been identical with and even inextricable from practical common sense.
Let us teach him that in order to be free and equal he must first be worthy of it and then forever afterward work to hold and keep and defend it.
He must learn to cease forever more thinking likegro and acting likegro.
This will not be easy for him.
His burden will be that because of his race and color it will not suffice for him to think and act like just any white man.
He must think and act like the best among white men.
Because where the white man because of his race and color can practice morality and rectitude just on Sunday and let the rest of the week go hang the Negro can never let up nor deviate.
That is our job here in the South.
It is possible that the white race and the Negro race can never really like and trust each other—this for the reason that the white man can never really know the Negro because the white man has forced the Negro to be alwayegro rather than another human being in their dealings.
And therefore the Negro cannot afford does not dare to be open with the white man and let the white man know what he the Negro thinks.
Buo know that we in the South having grown up and lived among Negroes for generations are capable in individual cases of liking and trusting individual Negroes which the North can never do because the northerner only fears him.
So we alone can teach the Negro the responsibility of personal morality and rectitude either by taking him into our white schools or giving him white teachers in his own schools until we have taught the teachers of his own race to teach and train him in these hard and unpleasant habits.
Whether or not he ever learns his ABCs or what to do with common fractions won't matter.
What he must learn are the hard things—self-restraint honesty dependability purity to act not even as well as just any white man but to act as well as the best of white men.
If we don't we will spend the rest of our lives dodging among the five hundred unbridled horses.
We will look forward each year to another Clinton or Little Rock not only further and further to wreck what we have so far created of peaceful relations between the two races but to be international monuments and milestones to our ridicule and shame.
And the place for this to begin is Virginia the mother of all the rest of us through the South.
Compared to you my country—Mississippi Alabama Arkansas—is still frontier still wilderness.
Yet even in our wilderness we look back to that mother stock as though it were not really so distant and so far removed.
Even in our wilderness the old Virginia blood still runs and the old Virginia names—Byrd and Lee and Carter—still endure.
There is no family in our wilderness but has that old aunt or grandmother to tell the children as soon as they can hear and understand "Your blood is Virginia blood too.
Your great-great-great-grandfather was born in Rockbridge or Fairfax or Prince George Valley or Piedmont or Tidewater" right down to the nearest milestone so that Virginia iiving place to that child long before he ever heard or cares about New York or for that matter America.
So let it begin in Virginia toward whom the rest of us are already looking as the child looks toward the parent foigignal where to go and how to goundred years ago the hot-heads of Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina would not listen when the mother of us all tried to check our reckless and headlong course.
We ignored you then to all our grief.
Yours more than any since you bore more of the battles.
But this time we will hear you.
Let this be the voice of that wilderness speaking not just to Mother Virginia but to the best of her children—sons found and chosen worthy to be trained to the old pattern in the University established by  Jefferson to be not jusead monument to but the enduring fountain of his principles of order within the human condition and the relationship of man with man—the messenger the mouthpiece of all saying to the mother of us all "Show us the way and lead us in it.elieve we will follow you.
is good enough to answer any questions that you care to raise.
You don't have to take issue with the very fine sentiments just expressed.Sir you spoke of the Negro ahild more or less who had to be taught how to live like—like the best white man but do you think that before that that the—well the—awful lot of this trouble that's been caused for colored people are by irresponsible white people?
Don't you think it would bood idea to educate the white people to accept the Negroeo.
Of course this could go into—to great lengthas simply stating the proposition in its simplest terms as it seemed to mehink that all that—that don't violently repudiate what I've said will agree that the white man is responsible for the Negro's condition the fact that the Negro does act likegro and can live among us and be irresponsible that the white man has got to be himself capable to teach the Negro to be more responsible than he is.
Yegree with you.
But then the Negro is not going to wait right now while the white man educates himself in order to educate the Negro.
We've got to do both at the same time.
The Negro is not going to wait any longer.
Yes sir.Sir in your talk you had an analogy comparing the Negro with—with unbridled horses.
If you tried to break these unbridled horses and you turneot of tame ones in don't you think it'ossibility that you may wind up with jusig group of half-wild horses?
Well of courssed the—the horse as a—auick analogy to—to statondition.
Whaeant by that was the horse that—that can be trained and maybe has been trained—we'll assume that—that while that horse walave then—then he was a—a docile well-behaved horse.
But then he was—the burden of slavery was lifted from him and he was suddenly freed.
That he is still capable of beinocile member of society but the condition in which he was compelled to bocile member is gone and so we will have to establisew condition in which he is—is docile not through pressure but because he himself wants to be.
He has got to be taught that it's best for me to—to pull my share in the traces if that's what we've got to do than to run wild.
don't you feel that if Virginia did integrate that the people in Mississippi and Alabama and Arkansas and those places would sort of lose their respect for Virginians as Southerners and sort of classify them as sort of northerners?
No sir I—I do not.
There's a—a noisy minority in Mississippi and Arkansas and—anather think it's in Virginia too that will go to any length before they will—will risk in any way improving the Negro's class condition for economic reasons.
That's—that's what's so in Mississippi anyway.
But there are people in Mississippi and in Alabama and in Georgia in the middle of—of—of where the Ku Klux Klan and Citizens Councils are active that do believe that whether they like it or not there'ituation now which simply will not go on any longer and our choice is either to do nothing and be run over and—and trampled or take ourselves try to take charge of these unbridled horses.
Anhink that if—if the people in Mississippi and Arkansas and Alabama could find that there were people in Virginia that would take the lead in this they would follow for the reason that there iespect a—a feeling of veneration toward Virginia that exists aried to explain everywhere in the rest of the South.
Whether it's—it's valid or noon't know and from some of the things thaave seen Virginia do since I've been heray agree that it's not too valid buhink that basically there is that feeling anelieve that there is in Virginia the capacity to take the first step in solving—solving this problem and if it is taken in Virginia the people in Mississippi and Alabama will follow when they wouldn't follow Alabama nor Mississippi.There's someone over here.
Yes sir.
on the subject of race relations it seems to me that the continuum in the United States is one of polarity that is the only view tolerated is an—is the extreme view.
If you agree with that premise of mine would you say that there will be resurgence—a resurgence ooderate view on this subject and what is your conception of that view would say that the Negro doesn't want to mix with white people any more than white people want to mix with the Negro.
The Negro simply wants the right himself to decide not to mixhink that—that he doesn't want to—to go to white schools just because they're white schoolshink he wants to go to them because he's under the delusion that white schools are good schools.
audience laughtehink from—from what I've seen oot of schools that no really industrious Negro would want to go to one.
Now that's not true of all schools but—but it's true of too many white schoolshink that what he wants is mainly the chance himself to decide to be segregated and that if he had that with schools so good that the people in the schools would be too busy passing the work to care what color who's sitting next to them was there wouldn't be any trouble about integration in schools.
Yes sir.Sir would you consider one of the problems—disregarding that you mentioned that the Negro was fighting for the chance to be able to segregate himself—is it not true that that is what the white southerner is fighting to maintain?
In other words if the Negro is fighting for the right of association aren't the southerners fighting for the equivalent right to disassociate?
In other words they don't feel like sacrificing their rights completely in order for the Negro to achieve the same rights.
In other words they don't feel that they are balanced.
Do you think that ialid cause for the southern white to be fighting so strenuously to preserve his equivalent right of disassociation would say it's valid assuming that the southerner's fear is validhink that his—his violent attitude toward integration is based in fear.
It's—in Mississippi it's mainly an economic fear that he has trained the Negro to—to get along with—with inferior tools and bad stock and yet to makiving and send his children to school.
The white man is afraid that if the Negro has better tools and better stock the Negro will take the white man's economy away from himhink he is afraid that if he gives the Negrhance to choose to be segregated the Negro may not choose it that if he was just convinced that—that the Negro would want to keep his own churches and his own schools and not mix with white people then the white man would give him that chance buoubt if—if some of the white people in the South can ever be brought to take that chance.
Yes sir.elieve you inferred in the earlier part of your speech thaood deal of the prejudice is against the Negro because of his color and if that be sonder if you really think that integration is going to solve this prejudice myself think that—that integration as they mean it now will—will never occur that the Negro doesn't want it eitherould say though in—in five hundred years he will have vanished anmagine then anyone that wants to join the D.A.R.
will have to prove that—that she's got somewhertrain of Negro blood that they'll be descendants  of ...  but as—I think as the NAACP preaches it and as the White Citizens Councils preach against it it—it won't occur because the Negro himself aace doesn't want to mix with white people.
He don't like white people that well.
Buo think that all the laws in the world are not going to make the two races mix if—if they don't want to just as all the laws in the world won't keep them apart if they do want to.
Yes sir.Virginia anhink several other Southern states have laws which say that in case schools are mixed with colored and white these schools will be closed.
Do you think that when these schools are closed the communities will finally come about to deciding that it's better to integrate and educate or just do away with education think they will come around to integrate for the reason that we have—have made our schools in this country tort oational system of babysitters and by the time these children  have been at home underfoot the parents are going to be willing for them to go to school no matter who else is there.
Yes sir.Sir what specific program would you advocate to implement this education of the Negro race would say first to raise the standard of all the schools to the bestould let everyone that can pass the board go to that school.
He might have one chance to fail.
If he fails he goes trade school.
If he fails there he goes to the Army.
and conversatioean by that that education should brivilege.
It shouldn't buty that I'm made to do by law whetheant to or not.
That is the law can make me go to school but they can't make me do anything theron't want to.
It should brivilege.
People should be willing to—to walk four or five miles to get to school.
Yes sir.Do you agree with the administration's proposal for federal aid to the schoolses if—if the standards of the schools were improvedhink that—that more money ain't going to improve the schools that the schools themselves are going to have to begin to improve themselves.
They're going to have to get rid oot of people that don't have any business in school.
They've got to give teachers better pay and give the teacher some pride in his job and some security that nobody will—will fire him.
But yes it—federal aid will—will have to go to the schools becaushink the—the communities can't or—or won't.
I'm sorry—And at what age do you advocate this entrance examination for students—elementary school or high schoolhat should—I should think the entrance examination would come only to give the failurecond chance that he can go to school as he does now.
The first time he fails he goes trade school but he will have the right to swot up and take an entrance examination to get back into the grade that he—he losthink that at college it should board yes.
That no matter what credits he brings from his school he should pasoard examination to get into college yes.
Yes.Sir do you think that the federal government will allow the Negro to make this choice that you're talking abouthe federal governmenmagine will do whatever the—the most folks hollering the loudest at it insist on.
Yes sir.It seems like the various groups up North which are pushing integration so hard now will—should the South try to adopt this voluntary segregation—leave the—both the white and black alone then to make that choice or do you think it's sort of wrapped up in—in power politics from the large northern cities that we are going to continue to be the whipping boy for better or worse think that most of the—the noisy vociferous people in the North don't really know what they're talking about.
If they would come down here and look at it they would knoood deal more than they do now.
Anhink that they are going to learn because there are more and more Negroes moving to the North.
In my county there were 6000 people moved out since the last sentence—census.
There were—something like 4800 of them were—were Negroesas through the country last winter bird-shootingould see houses empty house after house.
One family on my place gone to Chicago.
How long they'll staon't knowmagine they'll be back iear but they've—  Anhink when more and more of these people begin to crowd in among the white folks in the Nortot of them that talk so loud now will begin to change their tune.
Yes sir.Sir if the Negroes are the wild horses which you imply they are how are they to pass the entrance exams?
It seems to me they'll all end up in the Army and we'll be right back right where we started from.
Well sir that was an unfortunate simile but I—I used something  that we were all familiar with to express quicklondition in which ten percent of the population were—were not allowed to—to be members of the population except under sufferance.
That's aleantidn't mean that they were horses at all.
We could reverse it and say that a—a community of fifty thousand horses with five hundred loose men moving around in it if you like.
audience laughteimply meant that we have got to—to—to find some—some mutual ground to meet on not socially so much as economically and—and of course that—that implies education culture.
That is the Negro can be equal without having to—to come in and sleep with you.
Yes sir.
it seems that the need by the early first colonies the need for an agrarian society to have labor gave birth to this great problem and it also seems that the continual effort and attempt to maintain the society even after 1865 has prolonged and added to the problem.
Do you think and this is my question that the advent of industry in the South the industrialization of the South and the possible eventual destruction of the remaining—of the agrarian—agrarian society will have any effect upon this problem?
... and the possible eventual destruction of the remaining—of the agrarian—agrarian society will have any effect upon this problemt will in thahink—the agrarian culture was the only culture the white man went to much trouble to—to train the Negro in.
As that vanishes the Negro becomes more and more oroblem.
When that's completely gone he will be still more and more oroblem and for that reason the white man will have to do something to—to substitute that agrarian economy which took care of the Negro.
I—I mean by—by "took care" which assimilated the Negro.
The Negro had a—a definite place in that economy.
Now the only contact the Negro has with the white man's culture is the time-payment icebox and—and the automobile that he'll own some day if he don't tear it up before he finishes paying for it  but there's no other contact with the white man's culture that the Negro has since he was—since he left the agrarian economy of slavery.
Yes sir.I'd like to probe—really question your statement that no nation can exist with second-class citizens.
I'm not aware of any civilization either ancient or modern that has not in some form haecond-class citizenry.
For example the Hellenic civilization probably reached its flower because the leisure of—of one class was made possible by the labors of ones who were not only second-class citizens but worse.
I'm not defending second-class citizenship but it seems that some civilizations exist not only in spite of it but in fact because of the second-class citizenship.
Sould like to know if there is historical precedent for your statements.Thion't know any of those civilizations that have not haecond-class citizenship buon't know of any of them in which that second-class citizenship was an arbitrary condition compelled on the second-class citizen by the others.
He found his own second-class level.
He was not compelled to it by the color of his skin.
If that second-class citizen could rise from—from his second-class citizenship he was—he was allowed to.
There was nothing to stop him.
In our economy it's pretty hard for the Negro to get very far.
That's the only difference.
Yes sir.In Egypt many thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of workers that were held in slavery and they could not get out of it.
... those people ....
True but some of them broke out.
You know Moses leig gang of them out himself.
and talking  Yes sir.
audience talkingI think as you were talking you're taking as the best man being ... and since ... activities eventually taking—and taking interest in what we're doinhile voting you want the best way of educating people who are thinking about the unity not only themselves.
Don't you think that there should breat attempt to encourage the Negro to vote as much as possible in the South and to think of what he's doing rather than going to practically every means to discourage him as at presentell sir in—in principle yes buhink that to givaote when he has no conception of what he's voting for or against is not going to improve him nor his condition muchtill think that the education should come first but thegree thaot of white folks that vote haven't got any business voting too  but just because they do vote it's not going to help things to givot of Negroes that haven't got any business voting the right to votehink that—that if we've got to start educating somebody somewhere then let's start with—with what is amenable to it and the Negro—in his present condition he wants to advance himself.
He would be more amenable to education than the white man would because the white man has got spoiled by it.
The white man says "My laws make me go to school and if it—I've got to havood school that suits me.
I've got to havood football team oin't going there.
I've got to have cheerleaders oay not like it."
The Negrhink anxious to better his condition—anope that some of his leaders tell him it can be done only by education—might be more amenable to education to realize the responsibility that he has when he has the right to vote.
Yes sir.Sir do you think that the integration policies in the North have been successful and if not why?
audience talking  Well probably no integration policies have been successful but then most of the agrarian policies have not been too successful yet somehow agriculture advances somehow the—the—the human condition in which Negroes and whites have to live has advanced slowly.
It has gone backward since that Supreme Court decision but since '65 it had advanced gradually and steadily anhink that it will continue to advance gradually—gradually and steadily.
Yes sir.Sir before you made the statement that the northerners were afraid of the Negro.
What are your reasons for thathat conclusion's drawn from—from the experience I've had with the northerners.
They—they—they love the Negro in theory but they don't want much to do with him.
I've noticed that the southerner he—he don't love the Negro in quantities but he will defend some particular Negro.
It may be the nigger just owes him money—but anyway  whatever the reason is he will defend him.
And that's whaeantimply generalized from what I've heard northerners say.
They—they—they express so many to me bizarre reasons for the Negro's desire to—to advance himself.
They seem to think that—that he's—wants to take revenge on long oppression from the white race.
That may be true in—in certain cases buhink in general the Negro don't especially want revenge on the white man that—that his attitude toward the white man is something like the white man's toward him.
He likeew of them but he don't think much of all of them.
But his low opinion of all of them is not worth going treat deal of trouble to get revenge.
Yes sir.Sion't mean to suggest that I'ortherner but  we often say that the northerner ought to come down and see how things are going on and we often say that they don't understand our problems yet we in the South have an opportunity to do something progressive anon't think that any of our leaders have ever come up witood working plan yet.
What do you think about that agree with you.
That's what I'm talking about tonightgree with you.
But theon't know of any of—of the northerners that have come up witood practical working plan yet.
Yes sir.Sir anderstand it you believe that much of the leadership problem that we've got today is caused by an active noisy minority in each state and if so if I've understood you correctlonder what your reasons are for believing for thinking or for wondering why the hapless majority refrains or keeps from using their numerical superiority to overcome this leadership problem.
Well one reason is they don't want to be mixed up in something unpleasant.
Another reason is that—that people that compose that noisy majority—minority—in Mississippi anyway if you say something or do something they don't like they may set your house on fire.
Yes sir.
Sir if Virginia's plea for moderation was ignored once before with particularly disastrous consequences to her as you mentioned before do you think there's much hope for Virginia particularly caring to take the lead in the South on this questiont seems to me she should.
It seems to me that—that Virginia should feel something of the same responsibility toward the other states of the South—that the Virginia younger sons moved into with the surplus slaves two hundred years ago—that the father might feel toward his sons.
It's a—I would say maybe the strongest tie would be some tie an—an attenuation but still intact of blood of culture of thought of having shared in—in the same disastershink it's—there'efinite tiehink that—that Virginia that what we'll if you'll allow me the soul of Virginia feels the same tie toward Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia as the soul of Mississippi and Alabama feel and of—of—of respect toward the—the mother stock in Virginiahink that that's—that's an—an actual condition.
Yes sir.Sir in the Deep South Mississippi and Alabama the people seem to be controlled more or less by the Ku Klux Klan.
You mentioned the houseburnings and stuff like that.
And do you think any examples that we set or any reasons we give are going to break through those—those members of the Ku Klux Klan who are backed iot of cases by the law enforcement agencies who are—are pretty ignoranot of them?
Do you think that we can do anything to break through their attitude think so.
That's the poinake.
If—if there waefinite quality of—of leadership in common sense apart from emotion and any dragging out of old battle flags that the South the wilderness the frontier part of the South could hear and know about they would have some—some reason to feel that if we can throw off these—these noisy people too that there are people in other parts of the South that feel as we do.
The—the liberal in Mississippi he's hemmed in more or less by the sort of people that burn crosses and—and whip Negroes and compose lynching parties and he's afraid to say anything.
Well he knows that if he says too much something unpleasant may happen to him.
Then no matter what he says it may not do any good.
But if he found out that there were people in other states that felt the same way as he does just as the people that—that form Citizens Councils and the KKK they find out that there are people in other states that—that feel the same way so it builds them uphink that's what we need.
The people that—that will look on this as something that is—is going to change whether we like it or not.
It may be that—that all of us curse the day when the first slave was sold into this country but that's too late now.
And to live in—in this country anywhere in the world today and to—to—to be against givinan what equality—cultural educational economic—that he's capable and responsible for is like living in Alaska and being against snow.
You've got snow.
It's—it's foolish to be against it.
You've got it.
Yes sir.Sir this is jusimple questionondered if you could tell us if there's any particular class or economic group in the South which the Klan draws its members from or whether they come from all walks of life in the South.
By and large they come from the—the poor unsuccessful white man.
He has—has worked hard by his lights and of course he has worked hard.
He never gets very far ahead and he knows that he never will.
He sees the Negro with the same sort of land he's got with poorer tools and not as much credit as he's got maketter job of it to—to raise his family and they seem to be happier than he does.
And he—he doesn't like that.
He's envious.
He hates the Negro because the Negro is beating him at his own poor game which is—is to makiving on forty acres of poor land.
His only superiority over that Negro is—is not economic any longer.
It's because he's white and that Negro's not white and so he's going to do everything he can to keep that Negro black because it makes him feel good.
That's the only thing the only edge he has.
Yes sir.
in the light of what you've just said you also said that the Negro won't wait any longer and that he will demand rights and that there's not time to educate the white man but don't you really think that it's—it iatter of time anong time before the Mississippian or the south Alabamian will actually accept any sort of integration in the Southegree with youhink it will be at least fifty years.
I—I meant that—that the Negro is now in motion toward more equality and he's goot of white folks and government bureaus and courts behind himidn't mean that he's going to—going to either blow the country up or change it tomorroweant that—that now he has got pressure outside forces helping him move forward and that is whahink we've got to—got to cope with.
Either use it direct it or let it run over us.
But it will be fifty years before at least before the integration as the NAACP talks about it if that ever does come.
But he will—it will be less time than that before he gets more equality than he's gothink it'll be less time than that before he can vote in Mississippi or before his—he—he has to pay the same interest on his borrowed money the white man does thahite man can't cheat him can't charge things oarm commissary book and refuse to let the Negro add up the figures as he can do now in Mississippi.
Yes sir.Siot of southerners argue that complete integration would greatly lower our standards of education but don't you believe that withiew years after complete integration if it worked even moderately well there would be an overall improvement in our standards of education don't know.
It seems to me to improve standards of education we've got to get some folks out of the schools not get more in it that don't belong there.
Yes sir.Sir beiniberal in Mississippi as it seems to me you are you have probably had experiences with this vociferous group that seems to know only violence to accomplish its means.
It seems to me that—that you might have had some experience with this group and my question is have you and if you have could you relate what they wereell quite often as individuals they are—are not too dangerous.
They're just noisy.
When enough of them get together they can usually be handled as those North Carolina Indians got rid of theirs.
Thaittle firmness will dot with them.
Of course that don't keep them from coming around at night and setting fire to the barn.
That's just an occupational hazard you've got to live with.
Yes sir.Since you say Virginia must take the first step how would you propose this especially since the administration has closed the door as far as education is concernedell that would be something which Virginians must decide.
Whaope is that Virginia will say "Something has got to be done about this and you people in Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia let's decide what to do either to control it or let it run over us.
"We did havote here though sir and whether it was overlooked—the Gray Plan—justart in the right direction.
...  Well the only answer to that is to vote again and vote again  and vote again.
If you tell people something often enough and long enough whether they believe you or not they may follow you just to get you to hush.
Yes sir.Sir it seems to me that the main contention here tonight is that the economic and educational status of the Negro has propagated in him mores which are detrimental to our society.
If this is so why not while segregated raise his economic standards and raise his educational standardsoogree with you.
That's what I'd like to do.Furthermore—ould like to give him such good schools that he wouldn't want to go to the white schoolsould like to give him so much equality in his own race and responsibility for it and make him have to spend so much time being responsible for his own equality he wouldn't have time to bother with the white man's.
Yegree with you.
That's whaould do.
Yes sir.Sir would you advocate letting the Negro pay his own taxes tooell don't he?
... we know.
Well he—some of him does.
He gets drafted into the Army just like he wahite man.
He risks the same death ahite man does.
And probably if he had the vote he'd vote for the same scalawag and scoundrel the white folks elect but he would at least have the— have the right to have voted for him.
Yes sir.Sir assuming that we in Virginia take the initiative to lead in this integration movement for the South what guarantee if any do we have that incidents similar to those that just happened in New York in the last couple of weeks won't happen again down here?
If we don't have any guarantee what steps would you suggest that we take to stall off any such incidents?
Particularly ... the knifing and robberies and so forth.ould say that we train the Negro first into the responsibility of having the privilege of going to the white school before we dump him into it that he should be—be selected by rigorous examination before he was permitted into the white schools.
In the meantime white teachers should be sent to the Negro schools to train the Negro teachers how to teach the Negro students to be equal responsible for the right to go to the white schoolshink if that's—I'm sure what we all want not to happen ihing like Little Rock or Clinton to have troops with bayonets compel Negroes into white Virginia or Mississippi schools.
That's exactly aee it what we're trying to prevent which is—if we don't do something we will have.
Yes sir.
the Negro professional men of the South—its doctors in particular and the lawyers—themselves act alockade against the younger the better-educated Negroes.
In important matters in the medical societies they won't let them pass the board examinations so what are we going to do about that?
You have these old guard Negroes who won't let the new better-educated—the more liberal Negroes in as leaders.
They will have to be bypassed just like the—the old-guard white people that want to—to stop progress will have to be bypassed.
We don't have time any more to—to wait around for the old mossbacks to die off.
That might solve it if we had more time but we don't.
Something's got to be done pretty soon and they would have to be bypassed.
And I'm quite sure there'ot of that that they prefer the status quo they don't want to change and upset things that probably they—they don't wanot of—of smart young Negro doctors and lawyers getting in their hair.
It makes them behavood deal like white folks.
Yes sir.
aoreigneave regarded the southerners and the northerners all Americans as members of the American nation but here and elsewherave observed that there iifference between the southerner and the northerner.
Aneroblem here which seems to me greater or more dangerous than the problem of segregation against the Negroes.
Would you please comment thinnderstand what you mean buon't believe any problem can face this country that we won't drop everything and confederate on unless it may be the abolishment of automobiles.
But we are not going to confederate on the problem of segregation.
That's the only issue that—that we—we balk at.
But anything else is ephemeral and the—and the American don't take that seriously any more than he takes most of the—of the stuff he talks seriously thareat deal of his talk that sounds serious and meaningful to the foreigner it don't to the American because he—it never occurs to him that anybody's going to really believe that but—... one or two more Whatever—whatever you ever like.Let's give them about two or three more and then ....
If we have about two more questions and thehink we've helong enough.
Yes sir.I think this last comment is of some interest anas wondering if you felt that the problem which we face in Virginia and in the South has any strong international consequences insofar as the future of the Western civilization.
That is what do our neighbors across the oceans think of us in Virginia let's say as this young man has just pointed out when they observe our actions in regard to Negroes imagine that they havery—pretty—a very poor opinion of us buhink that their opinion of us is not near as important right now as what—what we—Virginians and Mississippians and Alabamians—have got to think about ourselves.
Let's look after our own opinion about our behavior and then let's worry about what somebody else thinks about it.As slow and as inefficient as it may be do you feel that the best problem or the best solution to race integration would be race assimilationo sion't think that that would—would solve many problems.
The same amount of—of bickering would go on and they would find another subject for ithink that the only thing that will solve that problem is—is not integration but equality for the Negro to know that he has just as much and just as valid rights in this country as anybody else has.
That his money is just as secure.
His children havight to just as good an education as anybody else does.
His vote counts as much as anybody else's.
That he don't have to pay any more for the Cadillac that he dreams of owning some day than the white man has to pay for it.I know I'm speaking for each one of us wheay we're all most grateful toery interesting anery stimulating evening.
That concludes this evening.
... and as we get into the final month he's answereood many questions.
About the only one he hasn't heard that's familiar to all teachers is "Will that be on the examination's by now an old member of the English Department although we did not accord him with the title of professor we can ask him almost—we can ask hiot more things than we can ask professors so now's our chance.
Yes sir.
one of your novels Requiem foun has been adapted to the theater and was successfully presented in Paris and England.
Do you feel others of your works might be successfully dramatized too and do you plan to do it—I don't knowon't know too much about theaterrote that book alay.
It wasn't adapted.
There were sections of it—it—the story fell into three acts told in dramatic form.
It was—I—I think played that way.
There were no adaptations and no changes.
Of course there may have been some changes when Albert Camus got hold of it in Paris.
He turned it into an existentialist job but he didn't change it too muchhink the—the version in—in London was about arote it but it was—was written in that formelt at the time that that was the most effective way to tell the storas trying to tellhink that's one of the tools of the writer's craft that he is at liberty to use whatever method he thinks does the job best.
Yes sir.
Douglas Daomain Gary wrote recently that he refuses to write only from his own experience because it limits one so.
Do you believe that it's possible for—for good fiction to be written bovelist who attempts to write of things beyond the limits of his own experienceh yes.
Of course you've got to define what you mean by experience.
If you restrict experience to what you yourself have—have done that is a—a limited field and you would have onlimited field to write from.
To—to me experience is—is anything that you have perceived.
It can come from—from booksook that—a story that is—is true enough and alive enough to move you that in my opinion is—is your experience is one of your experiences.
You need not to do the—the actions that the people in that book do but if they strike you as being true that they are things that people would do that you can understand the feeling behind them that made them do that then that's an experience to me.
And so in my definition of experience you—it's impossible to write anything that is not an experience because everything you have—have read have heard have sensed have imagined iart of experience.
That ihink there's as much of memory in the—the nerves and the muscles as there is in the gray matter.
Yes sir.I havuestioort of along these lines.
It'ittle long yeope you'll bear with me.
Yes sir.
Go slow with it son't miss it.I certainly will.
As background on it  Gwynn asked us to—to write an outline oovel that we wanted to write last semester.
It was quitifficult task for me at any rate and here it is the question which comes out of that attempt to write that outlineometimes think that the writer who tells the truth has an almost insurmountable problem.
First he must know what and how other people think and second he must record what he knows in his artistic creation.
If you agree with this premise which part of the writer's task is the more difficult knowinharacter that is what he believes and how he reacts to the situations and so forth or once you know it getting it down on paperow there's another case where we've got to define terms.
In my opinion truth don't have very much relation to facts that some things you imagine or you hear you know is true.
Maybe it ain't so but it should be so.
That to me is truth.
Now give me the second half of your question again.Well the second half as—aook at the problem of writing the novel is once you have your character in mind then getting him down on paper telling about the character describing his thoughts or his opinions or how he reacts under pressure or his philosophy is getting that down—that's thuppose the mechanical part.
Now what to me is first you know your character and you know what he's like.
You know him and then you have to put him down on—on the paper as you're writing anas wondering if that is the sort of the way you approacovel which it probably is not but if it is which would you say is—is the hardest of the two problems to—to get your character in your mind or to get him down on paper once you have him in your mind would say to get the character in your mind.
Once he is in your mind and he is right and he's true then he does the work himself.
All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says.
It's the—the ingestion and then the gestation.
You've got to know the character.
You've got to believe in him.
You've got to—to feel that—that what—that he is—is alive and then of course you will have to dertain amount of—of picking and choosing among the possibilities of his action so that his actions fit the character which you believe in.
After that the—the—the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical.
It's—I think most of the—the writing has got to take place up here before you ever put the pencil to the paper.
But the character's got to be true by your conception and by your experience and that would include as we've just said what you've read what you've imagined what you've heard all that going to giving you the gauge to measure this imaginary character by and once he comes alive and true to you and—and he's important and moving then it's not too much trouble to put him down.
Yes ma'am.I think my question followittle bit from that oneas wondering to what extent is the creative literary process really sometimes painful and if facility in writing necessarily goes with excellence or the other way around.
And if it's too difficult does it appear to the reader as being labored and—and worked overometimes probablyhink of—of so much of Dreiser that must've beeerrific anguish to him to writean think of—well Flaubert say that—that sounds so easy so simple that must have beeerrific effort to him too.
Probably you can't—can't draw any—any general—generalization from that.
Now what was the question about the— the—the anguish and trouble.
We almost touched on that.
Tell me that again the first of your question was—I just wanted to know to what extent that in the creative literary process is or can be expected to be—ell it's anything that—that you like to do better than anything else of course you're willing to make sacrifices for and usually the things that you like to do are troublesome.
That is if you like to ski that's—that's difficult.
Everybody can't do it.
But if you like it well enough that very anguish is fun.
You do it because that gives you more pleasure than anything else you can think of.
It may be difficult just like mountain climbing.
Nobody would climb mountains just for fun.
People don't know why they climb mountains but that's their cup of tea they likehink that's true of the writer that he's—he's willing to face the—the anguish and the trouble of it because—one reason is he can't help it he—his choice is either to—to write or not write and he says "Well I'm going to write anyway."
The other is to have done the job well then he has—has been repaid for the trouble and the suffering we'll call it that he went through.
Also he has justified the fact that people must suffer.
There's really no good reason why there should be pain you know.
There's no biological reason for it and yet we constantly suffer pain and fear and if the individual can make something which—which makes him feel good that this is something that wasn't here before me and I've made it and it's—it's not quite good enough but it's the besan do anaood time at it then that is his—his pay for it.This sort of relates to the question before that but when you are writinovel abouarticular group of people anarticular environment just to what extent—how fully do you imagine these people and this environment beyond what actually goes into the novel think one of the—the first qualitieriter must have is an inherent incapacity to stick to the truth that he will—will take characters situations he has seen with the best intention in the world but despite himself he cannot stick to that.
He's going to improve it somehow.
He's trying to make somethinittle neittle different than what was here before and he's not going to worry too much about whether he sticks to the truth and he finds that he's got away from facean not the truth which is aust said there's not too much relation between fact and truth.
When he finds that he has got away from fact he doesn't worry about that.
Because he has dedicated himself to stick to truth as he sees itean by truth the—the things which move people.
The—the—the desires the passions in the human heart the things that the human heart considers important—honor and truth shame baseness courage—that's what he's writing about and when he's got to—to ignore fact to do that better then he won't hesitate to ignore fact because he's not really interested in facts.
Fact can change too much.
Fact can be one thing today and something else tomorrowosted sign can changact you know but it can't change the truth.
Yes sir.I think some magazines pay more for humorous stories than they do for stories oore serious nature at least I've hearumber of writers say that in relation to The New Yorker supposedly because humor is harder to write than—humorous stories are harder to write than serious ones.
Do you find that true in your writing that it's harder for you to writunny scenumorous scene than it is to write one oerious natureith me the character does the work and souldn't say that it's more difficult to writunny story thaad one.
Thahink the writer is mainly not writintory.
He's writing about people.
He thinks of the character.
He gets that character from observation from experience from imagination and suddenly that character himself or herself turns out to be funny and then she says and does funny thingshink maybe what you might calrofessional writer that—that has a—a knack for composition for knowing what magazines will pay the best price for and has the talent to—to write something to fit that now he may be able to answer that question better than me buhink I've found it more satisfactory to write mainly about people and let the character himself—if he's comic then he does and says comic things anon't thinould worry too much about that.
Yes sir.
you've stated that your method of composition is just to let the story write itself.
Anas wondering if you could tell us whether or not Sherwood Anderson wrote in a—similar to this fashion.hink so yes.
He—writing was—was very difficult for him because he took it up late in life and contrary to his tradition and his training.
He had been successful in the—the ordinary shape of the American dream which was to come from nothing and—and by your own shrewdness and skill make something of yourself and establisertain position in the community.
Then suddenly he decided he wanted to briter and he at his age he—he was thinking always "Well now aood enough to briter?
Is thiistake?
Maybe rather than to try to briter and faihould've stuck to whaad trained myself to do" and he himself didn't have the confidence in what he did.
It would be other people that would say "Well this is—this is splendid.
This is marvelous.
Few people can match that."
He never did quite believe that.
He was afraid that somebody might come along and say "This is nonsense it's trash."
And if someone had he would've believed that that he himself didn't have the confidence in what he did or in the doing of it which the person that begins to write to want to briter young has.
When you're young you know nothing.
You believe that you can climountain or can fly an aeroplane faster or ridacehorse than anybody else can.
You're not afraid to try anything.
But in his case he—he was afraid.
Did that answer the question or did it get away from the question?
Welon't know.
It—I thought it was very interestingon't know whether exactly was the thinas—  Well let's have your question againot off myself.
That's my fault.I—I was—just wanted to know if he wrote in the same fashion you did.
You said that you just let the story write itself anas wondering if he did the same thing.
Yes and—generally yeshink that all people write from—in—by the same method.
It'atter of—of imagining any number of things.
The writer at the moment of putting it down has got to bensor to say "Now this is—this is right this is wrong" and to throw away the wrong.
Anderson didn't quite have that—that confidence in his own capacity to pick and choose.
There was an instinct that would save him in the endot of—of the stuff that went into his—his storiean witeart or mind more sure of himself would've stricken out and would've gotten rid of some of the—the sense of fumbling and clumsiness the heavy-footedness which was in Anderson's stories which he himself didn't like but in my opinion it hareat deal to do with making his stories.
The very fact that they did sound clumsy and—and not quite strained buittle puzzled that the truth did come out of—of all the heavy-footedness and the—the fumbling the—whatever it was that—that made him go to the length of reducing some of it to the sort of First Reader statements gave something to the final result that—that no imitator could—could match probably.
But it was much more onhappy strain to him that he never got the—the pleasure of—out of writing thaore facile craftsman could've done.
It had nothing to do with the result of course but it just was.
Yes sir.
Even if he didn't have confidence in his own ability to write well do you think he had the confidence in his own vision of some truthbsolutelo.
That is why he stopped beinuccessful advertiser and became an artist.
He had absolute confidence in his vision and—and knew it was important enough for something to be done about it for him to try to—to tell it to show to people what he had seen which he—he in my opinion he did marvelously well but clumsily.
Yes sir.
this is another question about Anderson.
One critic suggested Sherwood Anderson felarticular kinship to Gertrude Stein.
Miss Stein is spoken of so frequently in connection with the writers of the Twenties thaould be interested to know whether you recall any discussion by Anderson of her of her work and its supposed influence upon himself.
Yes he had the—the unlettered man's boundless and almost baseless respect for—for literacy for education and she was—was an extremely versatile creature that way.
She spoke two or three different languages and she came froackground of people that took the best of education aatter of course which he didn't have.
Also she was one of the few people that he could trustean that—that when she said that what he was doing was—was good he never doubted it because he knew that she would never do anything to hurt him.
Other people that told him it was good he never did quite trust.
He said "Well—well maybe they'll—they'll do something to hurt me tomorrow.
I'm afraid of them."
But with her he never was because he knew that she was a—well you might saady and wasn't—was never going to hurt him.
Yes sir.
do you believe that Sherwood Anderson was too deliberate in his use of symbols or do you believe that some of his—these symbols were unconsciously used in Winesburg Ohio little of both.
You've got to remember that suddenly at the age of about 40 he decided to briter.
He had to learomplete new trade witomplete new equipment and up to that time he had probably not thought too much about symbolism.
He had to teach himself that as he went along.
But he—what he taught himself he—he would stop to prove to—to be sure that it was right that it was in—in accord with the—with the symbolism of—of the new psychology which was coming along at that time.
But he had to teach himself his trade as he went along.
Do you happen to remember how you first met  Andersonead—had worked iew York bookstore.
The manager was Elizabeth Praliss Prall then.
Lateeard that she had married Anderson was living in New Orleansappened to be in New Orleans anad gone to call on her because I—I wasn't going to—to bust in on  Anderson without an invitation from himidn't think thaould see him at all that he would probably be in his study working but it happened that he was in the room at the time.
And we talked and we liked one another from the start and it was this—just the chance thaad gone to call on Miss Prall thaad known who had been kind to me whealerk iook store thaame to meet him.
Sir I'd like to follow that up just once iay sir.
We were talking about the background of Anderson's writing and all of the writing out of the '20s and how people often gathered in groups in Greenwich Village and Chicago and New Orleans.
Was there something in New Orleans that pulled you down there or were—were you just making a—a tripell yead heard of The Double Dealer and the people there for years.
At that timent to New Orleans to—to geob ihip and go to Europe.
That was whappened to be in New Orleans at that time.
Thaadn't—it was no pull to bart oiterary group no.
Thaad felt the pull—I—I think that any young writers does feel that pull to—to be with people that—that have the same problems and—and the same interests as him that—that won't laugh at what he's trying to do that won't laugh at—at what he says no matter how foolish it might sound to the Philistine.
But that was the—the reasoas in New Orleans was to geob withip.
Yes sir.I'd like to follow up your remark about the Philistine for one minute ian.
During the past hundred years or so much has been said and written about the gulf between the writer and the other people of his own time.
If this gulf and supposed lack of understanding iertainty between the writer and his time does exist what would you suggest are some of its causesrobably the writer is just too confoundedly busy with his own private affairs to have much time for his contemporary scene that he's aware of it but he ain't too interested in it that to him the world is not just A.D. this particular year.
To him the world is all man would call anguish in the books and the plays and the poems.
That's where he lives.
He just happens to have to eat in—in 1958 but he don't really live there.
Yes sir.
it's been stated that you regard civilization as evil and nature as good and in "The Bear" you seem to indicate that the purity of untouched nature as opposed to the tainted air that hangs about the human spoilers of the wilderness that there is this difference.
Is this the result oelief that man if he returns tatural life can be rejuvenatedo and iver gave that impression in my work that's not quite truehink that with any writer—civilization his age his time iart of the equipment the reservoir that he will write from that that is the—the writer the artist probably don't think anything is either good or bad.
It just is and it's vastly interesting because it moves and that is the—the source and the material from which he's going to try to make something.
It's motion.
It's people no matter whether what they do is cowardly or brave or—ouisance or diverting or entertaining.
It's still motion and he himself hasn't got time or inclination either to judge ithink that anyone who says civilization is—is bad and—and non-civilization is therefore good and if man could just leave civilization and live iree and eat nuts  that he'd be better off I—some men might be better off with that but not everybody would.
If—if—if you like to live iree and eat nuts then you'd be better off and be happier  but the other people that are just as honorable and just as brave that live in the middle of civilization.
But that's all part of the—the reservoir that you write from.
That's part of the experience to be in the midst of it the motion.
Yes sir.Do you think that Sherwood Anderson could've expanded his Winesburg Ohio interies of novels as you've done with your Yoknapatawpha County people or do you think that he's necessarily more limited torm like the short storye was yes limited to that form and his tragedy was that he was limited to that one book that—that was—was truth as he saw it.
It was valid true truth but he had done it that one time and he never could do it again.
Because the truth it was as though the truth that he was capable of burst on him like a—a thunderclap all in one flash that there was nothing to progress from nor toward that it all happened to him like a—a—a house falling on him.
Yes sir.Sir many of the characters in Winesburg Ohio had the problem of not being able to communicate with their fellow man anhink some of your characters also seem to have that trouble.
Now you've said that the most important thing for man is for him to be able to believe in himself.
Do you believe that before he can believe in himself he must overcome this barrier of communication with otherse would be happier if he could overcome the barrieron't believe that the fact that he feels he can't communicate would have anything to do with his own belief in himselfon't think that—that whether the writer believes he can't communicate or not he can and he doesmagine that there's really nobody that—that doesn't communicate.
It may be he'll—he—he won't want to that he'll think that—that he's sufficient can be an island to himself but he can't.
Whether he wants to or not he belongs to mankind too.
And in the very fact of belonging to mankind he communicates with mankind.
He may not be able to do it articulately.
He may not have the—the quality of—of rhetoric but there's—there's more to communication than speech you know.That's whaeanteant just the characters that couldn't seem to get to know people in Winesburg Ohio.
There're quitew characters in that book that are sort of isolated and frustrated because they couldn't seem to get to know other peopleidn't mean writing or speech.
Oeehink that was—was out of Anderson's own nature that he himself didn't believe that communication was—was more difficulthink maybe that he expected more of people than he ever found in people and these characters in his book because of what they thought waack of—an inability to communicate was they simply couldn't find the—the—the fine virtues in mankind that  Anderson himself believed were there.
They're not there.
Man is capable of anything of everything but of no particular virtue no particular evil.
He's —It gives mreat deal of pleasure to havn this class in which we are trying to put down feelings and thoughts on paper and shaping observation and experience into narrative and essay.
Foon't know of anyone who really understands so well the longings and frustrations of human beings and has demonstrated so consistently his ability to record this understanding in what constituteort of vision of humanity ieries of stories and novels that are so remarkably skillfully writtenskef he would read something to us and he chostory entitled "Race at Morning."
He will read some portions of it which will make make time connect the whole.
After he has finished his readinope that you will ask questions on that story and any other questions that seem appropriate to the occasion.
It gives mreat deal of pleasure to introduco this class.
It was jest dust-dark wheeen him about haluarter up the river swimming jest his head above the water.
Buould see that rocking chair he toted on it annowed it was him going right back to that canebrake in the fork of the bayou where he lived all year until the day before the season opened like the game wardens had give hialendar when he would clear out and disappear nobody knowed where until the day after the season closed.
But here he was coming bacay ahead of time like maybe he had gotten mixed up and was using last year's calendar by mistake.
Which was jest too bad for him because me and Mister Ernest would be setting on the horse right over him when the sun rose tomorrow morning.
So we et supper and fed the dogs and theolp Mister Ernest in the poker game standing behind his chair until about ten o'clock when Roth Edmonds said "Why don't you go to bed boy"Or if you're going to set up" Willy Legate said "why don't you takpelling book to set up over?
.
He knows every cuss word in the dictionary every poker hand in the deck and every whisky label in the distillery but he can't even write his name .
Can youe says to me.
"I don't need to write my name downaid.
"I can remember in my mind whm."
"You're twelve years old" Walter Ewell said.
"Man to man now how many days in your life did you ever spend in schoolHe ain't got time to go to school" Willy Legate said.
"What's the use in going to school from September to middle of November when he'll have to quit then to come in here and do Ernest's hearing for him?
And what's the use in going back to school in January when in jest eleven months it will be November fifteenth again and he'll have to start all over telling Ernest which way the dogs wentWell stop looking into my hand anyway" Roth Edmonds said.
"What's that?
What's thatister Ernest said.
He wore his listening button in his ear all the time but he never brought the battery to camp with him because the cord would of bound to get snagged ever time we run throughicket.
In fact the only time he ever admitted he couldn't hear was when we'd be sitting on the horse waiting for me to tell him which way the dogs went.
Then it was morning.
We et and set the stand-holder across for Uncle Ike McCaslin to put them on the stands where he thought they ought to be because he was the oldest man in the camp.
He had been hunting deer in these woods for abouundred yeareckon and if anybody would know wheruck would pass it would be him.
Maybe witig old buck like this one that had been running the woods for what would amount tundred years ieer's life too him and Uncle Buck—Uncle Ike would sholy manage to be at the same place at the same time this morning—provided of course he managed to git away from me and Mister Ernest on the jump.
Because me and Mister Ernest was going to git him.
And sho enough as soon as we come to the bayou we seen his foot in the mud where he had come up out of the river last night spread in the soft mud likow's foot big aow's big aule's with Eagle and the other dogs laying into the leash rope now until Mister Ernest told me to jump down and help Simon hold them.
Because me and Mister Ernest knowed exactly where he would be—a little canebrake island in the middle of the bayou where he could lay up until whatever doe or little deer the dogs had happened to jump could go up or down the bayou in either direction and take the dogs on away so he could steal out and creep back down the bayou to the river and swim it and leave the country like he always done the day the season opened.
Which is jest what we never aimed for him to do this time.
So we left Roth on his horse to cut him off and turn him over Uncle Ike's standers if he tried to slip back down the bayou and me and Simon with the leashed dogs walked on up the bayou until Mister Ernest on the horse said it was fur enough; then turned up into the woods about haluarter above the brake because the wind was going to be south this morning when it riz and turned down toward the brake and Mister Ernest give the word to cast them and we slipped the leash and Mister Ernest give me the stirrup again anot up.
Old Eagle had done already took off because he knowed where that old son oun would be laying as good as we did not making no racket atall yet but jest boring on through the buck vines with the other dogs trailing along behind him and even Dan seemed to know about that buck too beginning to souple up and jumittle through the vines so thaaken my holt on Mister Ernest's belt already before the time had come for Mister Ernest to touch him.
Because when we got strung out going fast behineeasn't on Dan's back much of the time nohow but mostly jest strung out from my holt on Mister Ernest's belt so that Willy Legate said that when we was going through the woods fast it looked like Mister Ernest haoy-size pair of empty overhalls blowing out of his hind pocket.
So it wasn't evetrike it waump.
Eagle must 'a' walked right up behind him or maybe even stepped on him while he was laying there still thinking it was day after tomorrow.
Eagle jest throwed his head back and up and said "There he goes" and we even heard the buck crashing through the first of the cane.
Then all the other dogs was hollering behind him and Dan givquat to jump but it was against the curb this time not jest the snaffle and Mister Ernest let him down into the bayou and swung him around the brake and up the other bank.
Only he never had to say "Which wayecausas already pointing past his shoulder freshening my holt on the belt jest as Mister Ernest touched Dan with that big old rusty spur on his nigh heel because when Dan felt like it he could go off jest liktick of dynamite straight through whatever he could bust and over or under what he couldn't.
The dogs was already out of hearing.
Eagle must 'a' been looking right up that big son oun's tail until he finally decided he better git out of there.
And now they must 'a' been getting pretty close to Uncle Ike's standers and Mister Ernest reined Dan back and held him squatting and bouncing and trembling likule having his tail roached until we listened for the shots.
But never none come anollered to Mister Ernest we better go on whilould still hear the dogs and he let Dan off but still there wasn't no shots and now we knowed the race had done already passed the standers; and we busted out ohicket and sho enough there was Uncle Ike and Willy standing beside his foot ioft patch.
"He got through us all" Uncle Ike said.
"I don't know how he done itust halimpse of him.
He looked big big alephant witack on his head you could cradlellin' calf in.
He went right on down the ridge.
You better get on too; that Hog Bayou camp might not miss him."
Sreshened my holt and Mister Ernest touched Dan again.
The ridge run due south; it was clear of vines and bushes so we could go fast into the wind too because it had riz now and now the sun was up too.
So we could hear the dogs again any time now as the wind got up; we could even make time now but still holding Dan tanter because it was either going to be quick when he got down to the standers from that Hog Bayou camp eight miles below ourn oong time in case he got by them too.
And sho enough aftehile we heard the dogs; we was walking Dan now to let him blohile and we heard them the sound coming faint up the wind not running now but trailing because the big son oun had decideood piece back probably to pund to all the foolishness and picked hisself up and soupled out and put abouile between hisself and the dogs—until he run up on them other standers from that camp belowould almost see him stopped behinush peeping out and saying "What's this?
What's this?
Is this whole durn country full of folks this morninghen he looked back over his shoulder at where old Eagle and the others was hollering along after him while he decided how much time he had to decide what to do next.
We was in strange country now because we never had to run this fur before we had always killed before now; now we had come to Hog Bayou that runs into the riveood fifteen miles below our camp.
It had water in it not to mentioess of down trees and logs and such and Mister Ernest checked Dan again saying "Which way could just barely hear them off to the easittle like the old son oun had give up the idea of Vicksburg or New Orleans like he first seemed to have and had decided to havook at Alabama; sointed and we turned up the bayou hunting forossing and maybe we could 'a' found one except thaeckon Mister Ernest decided we never had time to wait.
We come tlace where the bayou had narrowed down to about twelve or fifteen feet and Mister Ernest said "Look out I'm going to touch him" and done it.idn't even have time to freshen my holt when we was already in the air and theeen the vine—it waoop of grapevine nigh as big as my wrist looping down right across the middle of the bayou—anhought Mister Ernest seen it too and was jest waiting to grab it and fling it up over our heads to go under it annow Dan seen it because he even ducked his head to jump under it.
But Mister Ernest never seen it atall until it skun back along Dan's neck and hooked under the head of the saddle horn us flying on through the air the loop of the vine gitting tighter and tighter until something somewhere was going to have to give.
It was the saddle girth.
It broke and Dan going on and scrabbling up the other bank bare nekkid except for the bridle and me and Mister Ernest and the saddle Mister Ernest still setting in the saddle holding the gun and me still holding onto Mister Ernest's belt hanging in the air over the bayou in the tightened loop of that vine like in the drawed-back loop oig rubber-banded slingshot until it snapped back and shot us back across the bayou and flang us clear me still holding onto Mister Ernest's belt and on the bottom now so that when we liould 'a' had Mister Ernest and the saddle both on top of me iadn't clumb fast around the saddle and up Mister Ernest's side so that when we landed it was the saddle first then Mister Ernest and me on top untiumped up and Mister Ernest still laying there with jest the white rim of his eyes showing.
"Mister Ernest!ollered and then clumb down to the bayou and scooped my cap full of water and clumb back and throwed it in his face and he opened his eyes and laid there on the saddle cussing me.
"God dawg it" he said "why didn't you stay behind where you started outYou was the biggest!aid.
"You would 'a' mashed me flat!"
"What do you think you done to meister Ernest said.
"Next time if you can't stay where you start out jump clear.
Don't climb up on top of me no more.
You hearYes siraid.
sound of turning pagesSo we caught Dan and got up and went on.
Then we seen him for the first time.
We was out of the cut-over now; we coulda even 'a' cantered except that all three of us was long past that.
So we was walking too when we come on the dogs— the puppies and one of the old ones—played out laying iittle wet swag panting jest looking up at us when we passed.
Then we come tong open glade and we seen the three other old dogs and abouundred yards ahead of them Eagle all walking not making no sound; and then suddenly at the fur end of the glade the buck hisself getting up from where he had been resting for the dogs to come up getting up without no hurry big big aule tall aule and turned and the white underside of his tail foecond or two before the thicket taken him.
It might 'a' beeignaood-barewell.
Still walking we passed the other three old dogs in the middle of the glade laying down too; and still that hundred yards ahead of them Eagle too not laying down because he was still on his feet but his legs was spraddled and his head was down; maybe jest waiting until we was out of sight of his shame his eyes saying plain as talk when we passed "I'm sorry boys but this here is all."
Mister Ernest stopped Dan.
"Jump down and look at his feet" he said.
"Nothing wrong with his feetaid.
"It's his wind has done give out."
"Jump down and look at his feet" Mister Ernest said.
Sone it and whilas stooping over Eaglould hear the pump gun go "Snick-cluck.
Snick-cluck.
Snick-cluck" three times except thaever thought nothing then.
Maybe he was jest running the shells through to be sho it would work when we seen him again or maybe to make sho they was all buckshot.
Theot up again and we went on still walkingittle west of north now because when we seen his white flag that second or two before the thicket hid it it was oeeline for that notch in the bayou.
And it was evening too now.
The wind had done dropped and there wadge in the air and the sun jest touched the tops of the trees.
And he was taking the easiest way too now going straight as he could.
When we seen his foot in the soft places he was running fohile at first after his rest.
But soon he was walking too like he knowed too where Eagle and the dogs was.
And then we seen him again.
It was the last time—a thicket with the sun coming througole onto it likearchlight.
He crashed jest once; then he was standing there broadside to us not twenty yards away big atatue and red as gold in the sun and the sun sparking on the tips of his horns—they was twelve of them —so he looked like he had twelve lighted candles branched around his head standing there looking at us while Mister Ernest raised the gun and aimed at his neck and the gun went "Click.
Snick-cluck.
Click.
Snick-cluck.
Click.
Snick-cluck" three times and Mister Ernest still holding the gun aimed while the buck turned and give us just one long bound the white underside of his tail liklaze of fire too until the thicket and the shadows put it out; and Mister Ernest laid the gun down slow and gentle back across the saddle in front of him saying quiet and peaceful and not much louder than jest breathing "God dawg.
God dawg."
Then he jogged me with his elbow and we got down easy and careful because of that ere cinch strop and he reached into his vest and taken out one of the cigars.
It was busted wherad fell on ieckon when we hit the ground.
He throwed it away and taken out the other one.
It was busted too so he bit ofunk of it to chew and throwed the rest away.
And now the sun was gone even from the tops of the trees and there wasn't nothing left buig—big red glare in the west.
"Don't worryaid.
"I ain't going to tell them you forgot to load your gun.
For that matter they don't need to know we even seed him."
"Much oblige" Mister Ernest said.
There wasn't going to be no moon tonight neither so he taken the compass off the whang leather loop in his buttonhole and handed me the gun and set the compass otump and stepped back and looked at it.
"Jest about the way we're headed now" he said and taken the gun from me and opened it and put one shell in the britch and taken up the compass anaken Dan's reins and we started with him in front with the compass in his hand.
Then it was morning tomorrow; it was all over now until next November next year and we could come back.
Uncle Ike and Willy and Walter and Roth and the rest of them had come in yestiddy soon as Eagle taken the buck out of hearing and they knowed that deer was gone to pack up and be ready to leave this morning for Yoknapatawpha where they lived until it would be November again and they could come back.
So as soon as we et breakfast Simon run them back up the river in the big boat to where they left their cars and pickups and now it wasn't nobody but jest me and Mister Ernest setting on the bench against the kitchen wall in the sun; Mister Ernest smokinigar—a whole one this time that Dan hadn't had no chance to jump him througrapevine and bust.
He hadn't washed his face neither when—where that vine had throwed him into the mud.
But that was all right too; his face usually did havmudge of mud or tractor grease or beard stubble on it because he wasn't jeslanter; he waarmer he worked as hard as ara one of his hands and tenants—which is whnowed from the very first that we would git along thaouldn't have no trouble with him and he wouldn't have no trouble with me from that very first day wheoke up and maw had done gone off with that Vicksburg road-house feller without even waiting to cook breakfast and the next morning pap was gone too and it was almost night and the next day wheearorse coming up anaken the gun thaad already throwehell into the britch when pap never come home last night and stood in the door while Mister Ernest rid up and said "Come on.
Your paw ain't coming back neither."
"You mean he give me to you said.
"Who carese said.
"Come onroughock for the door.
We'll send the pickup back tomorrow for whatever you want."
Some home with him and it was all right it was jest fine— his wife had died about three years ago—without no women to worry us or take off in the middle of the night witurn Vicksburg roadhouse jake without even waiting to cook breakfast.
And we would go home this afternoon too but not jest yet; we always stayed one more day after the others left because Uncle Ike always left what grub they hadn't et and the rest of the homemade corn whisky he drunk and that town whisky of Roth Edmondziz he called Scotch that smelled like it come out old bucket of roof paint; setting in the sun for one more day before we went back home to git ready to put in next year's crop of cotton and oats and beans and hay; and across the river yonder behind the wall of trees where the big woods started that old buck laying up in—up today in the sun too—resting today too without nobody to bother him until next November.
So at least one of us was glad it would be eleven months and two weeks before he would have to run that fur that fast again.
So he was glad of the very same thing we was sorry of and so all ouddehought how maybe planting and working and then harvesting oats and cotton and beans and hay wasn't jest something me and Mister Ernest done three hundred and fifty-one days to fill in the time until we could come back hunting again but it was something we had to do to do honest and good during the three hundred and fifty-one days to have the right to come back into the big woods and hunt for the other fourteen; and the fourteen days that the old buck run in front of dogs wasn't jest something to fill his time until the three hundred and fifty-one when he didn't have to but the running and the risking in front of the guns and dogs was something he had to do for fourteen days to have the right not to be bothered for the other three hundred and fifty-one.
And so all the hunting and the farming wasn't two different things at all—they was jest the other side of each other.
"Yesaid.
"All we got to do now is put in that next year's crop.
Then November won't be no time away."
"You ain't going to put in the crop next year" Mister Ernest said.
"You're going to school."
So at firsidn't even believad heard him.
"What said.
"Me?
Go to schoolYes" Mister Ernest said.
"You must take—make something out of yourself."
"I amaid.
"I'm doing it now.
I'm going to bunter anarmer like you."
"No" Mister Ernest said.
"That ain't enough any more.
Time was when alan had to do was just farm eleven analf months and hunt the other half.
But not now.
Now just to belong to the farming business and the hunting business ain't enough.
You got to belong to the business of mankind."
"Mankind said.
"Yes" Mister Ernest said.
"So you're going to school.
Because you got to know why.
You can belong to the farming and hunting business and you can learn the difference between what's right and what's wrong and do right.
And that used to be enough—just to do right.
But not now.
You got to know why it's right and why it's wrong and be able to tell the folks that never had no chance to learn it; teach them how to do what's right not just because they know it's right but because they know now why it's right because you just showed them told them taught them why.
So you're going to school."
"It's because you been listening to that durn Will Legate and Walter Ewell!aid.
"No" Mister Ernest said.
"Yes!aid.
"No wonder you missed that buck yestiddy taking ideas from the very fellers that let him git away after me and you had run Dan and the dogs durn nigh clean to death!
Because you never even missed him!
You never—you never forgot to load that gun!
You had done already—you had done already unloaded iurposeeard you!"
"All right all right" Mister Ernest said.
"Which would you rather have?
His bloody head and hide on the kitchen floor yonder and half his meat iickup truck on the way to Yoknapatawpha County or him with his head and hide and meat still together over yonder in that thicket waiting for next November for us to run him againAnd git him tooaid.
"We won't even fool with no Willy Legate and Walter Ewell next time."
"Maybe" Mister Ernest said.
"Yesaid.
"Maybe" Mister Ernest said.
"The best word in our language the best of all.
That's what mankind keeps going on Maybe.
The best days of his life ain't the ones when he said 'Yes' beforehand they're the ones when all he knew to say was 'Maybe.'
He can't say 'Yes' until afterward because he not only don't know it until then he don't want to know 'Yes' until then .
Step in the kitchen and make moddy.
Then we'll see about dinner."
"All rightaidot up.
"You want some of Uncle Ike's corn or that town whisky of Roth EdmondzizCan't you say Mister Roth or Mister Edmondsister Ernest said.
"Yes siraid.
"Well which do you want?
Uncle Ike's corn or that ere stuff of Roth Edmondzizudience laughterThank you very much  .In writing suctory as that which must be about concrete things that you've experienced—I don't know whether you've haollision witrapevine or not when you were oorse—but do you see that kind otory from beginning to end when you start writing?
Do you have that story sort of in mind the—the ending as part of the beginninghintory like that invents itself as you go along.
That one began with the—with the picture of—of that—that little boy—been abandoned by his mother and his father.
They were no good.
And—and by rights he should have been no good too.
But this man  Ernest with all his ignorance could see that—that here iuman being anuman being is capable of anything if he hahance to do it and—and the story came out of the fact that this—this crabbed old bachelor would see this—this waif and suddenly say He's too valuable to—to leave in the woods there.
And the story was simplatter of showing incidences to—to show the relationship between these two people that this—this old man suddenly had seeuty and was going to do it that he didn't know—he'd probably never been to school himself but he saw that something could be made out of this waif simply because that little waif wauman being.Sir in your own words in the beginning we were showing the hunt the way  Ernest took the boy—this was showing how he's—he sort of took him in and how he took him on things that he—went hunting or things like that—and how he took him into his lifees and the interdependence.
The man was deaf.
He couldn't hear which way the dogs went.
This little boy would ride behind him and say "They went that way.
"Well then couldn't you perhaps put the—the part toward the end where he took the boy after his parents had gone away first say and then have the hunt come afterwards after we know that the—that the man has taken the boy?
And then—  Could buhink that my way madetter story.
That's—that'atter of opinion buhink that mine to—for the payoff to come last waittle more effective.
If anything it makes the story seeittle more condensed shorter maybe.But you had first in—in mind the ending how it wases yes.When you wrote your—  Yes.
Well it was the relationship between these—these two people.
It waizarre relationship.
The—the story itself was—was simply an invention of—of anecdotes to tell the story and they come out of—of the storehouse which—which any writer has of experience of observation of imagination that he reaches around in his workbox and picks up whatever plank or board he will need.You think it is always the—the little twist that comes from the imagination which really makeind otory out of what is experienced that the additional thing which is really not experience which shapes it into some kind of story would say so.
That that has to be there.
It's—it's something of—of—of gold in—in the imagination which takes the—the trite familiar even dull incident and—and gives—gives ihine.One small point sir.
Did you sabayou"?
Is that what we who don't live around them calbayou"es they would've said "bayou."
Yes sir.When you were talking about the education being so that he could learn not only what was right but since he already knew what was right were you being—was that supposed to be sort of comicalo.
This uneducated ignorant man was fumbling after something which he had realized late in his life was not only true but important.
That—that no man can be an island to himself that you havesponsibility toward mankind.
That is you may do right because—through instinct or because it's been beat into you but that—that may be all right for you but you havesponsibility toward people that have not been trained to do right.
They've got to know why they must do right and only education can give you the—the—the rhetoric the—the—the capacity to think on your feet to explain to the—to the ignorant the intractable why something is right why he must do something because it's right.
That was—in fact the association with that child had—had done that much to the man.
If they hadn't met the man would have gone on and would have been content to—to be crabbed and ignorant and a—a—a hard farmer to makittle money every year but suddenly the responsibility of that child—that man too had entered the human race.
Iay they were—were to be the salvation of one another mutual salvation of one another.
Yes sir.You think then that the boy will go to school should think so yes.
He may—will probably never bhi Beta Kappa  but this man will—will see that he learns to read and write and—and with the hope the idea that maybe once he learns to read he will of his own curiosity read enough to—to learn why man does right himself.The—the boy then will be changed by going to school and the man will be changed also by having the responsibility of this orphanell the man would be changed by the responsibility of the orphan.
The little boy at that age was pretty well started in the way he would go.
All he needed was just an—an occasional prod and some directing that already he was—was truthful and—and brave and he was willing to—to give devotion fidelity.
All he needed was education to learn to read to—to—to know more of the history of his race.
The man was probably changed more than that little boy was.
The little boy was not changed so much as saved.
Yes sir.Then were they hunting not only the deer but iay themselves tooell of course they didn't know that but that's what they were finding.
That is the—the man had—in teaching the little boy that—that—that never to touch satiety was valid.
Maybe he had never thought of that before that his notion was to take the two weeks off and get out there and—and kill every deer that got up in front of him until suddenly his responsibility for the little boy made him stop and think Well what is better to just drag the dead meat in or—or to see the beautiful splendid creature run its native elementes sir.I—I thoughearittle bit oistfulness for the time whean didn't have to do anything but farm and hunt that maybe this—you said "Time was when all man had to do was—was farm and hunt."
Surely nobody really likes responsibility.
It may be this man hated the fact that he couldn't stay in his home at night and go on to sleep and let that little boy which he knew was—was lost and abandoned in a—iut in the woods to shift for himself but he couldn't.
He had to go and get him.
And yes he probably thought it "I—I wish we could go on like it used to be where people didn't have to be responsible wheran could be an island unto himself."
But once he realized that he couldn't he realized that neither could this little boy neither could any other human being that the responsibility—the acceptance of the responsibility increased all of us just like the refusal of it diminished all of us.
Yes sir.Sir would you say that that'ajor flaw in your old southern families that you picture like the Sartorises and the Compsons that they keep back from mankind and they act only for themselves and therefore turn in instead of out.. if you mean by that—that's true of any family whether they are southern or not.
They cling to an obsolescence whatever that obsolescence might be yes.
And people havendency to—to remember what was pleasant and the unpleasant part of that vanishes as memory attenuates so that all you remember is the happy part of it and the instinct is to go back to that happy part.
You don't always remember that if you went back to the happy part you'd have to go through with the—with the unhappy part again too.
That's partly clinging to the happy past.
It's partlack of—of something present to occupy.
Everybody iense needub of washing and the people like the Sartorises and Compsons they don't havub of washing anymore.
Yes sir.In the—the story and your discussion are you equating having education to book learningook learning is—iart of education that—I would say iad to define education I'd say it'apacity to increase always to—to know more tomorrow than you knew today no matter where you get it from.
You might get it from—from playing poker or from farming or from going to school or from fighting.
Book learning of course iart of education but book learning to my notion does not constitute education.
It's—nothing is of any value if you can't use it.
If you can't use it not so much to make other people better tomorrow but to make yourselittle better tomorrow than you are to know more to bittle wiser to be more sure of—of your own capacity to—to be honorable and brave.... you concede that some education happens in the schoolh yes.
Oh yes.So do you think then by going to school—if he wanted to just hunt and—and farm do you think he might have gone into something else now that he has gone to school and learned ... doubt it.
He would have—have found out that—what  Ernest tried to tell him that to have the—the—the right the privilege to do what you want foortnight in the year you've got to do something for the other 351 days that maybe you won't like that—that you have got to teach yourself or be taught discipline or nothing that you ever acquire will be any good to you if you don't have discipline.
And to go to school at his age was mainly the discipline of something that must be done.Do you mean the process of him going to school is—actually in the subjects that he would be taught he probably wouldn't learn anything that would be practical as far as him makiniving or—  That's right.
Not until he found out for instance that he liked to read.
Once you discover you like to read then nobody really needs to worry about your book education anymore.
You tend to that yourself unless you want to specialize in something.
when you put that title down "Race at Morning" did you think of the appropriateness of that title on really various levels.
That is the fact that the "morning" is the boy.
The "race" means human race as well as the literal race in the hunt?
You can interpret that title in various waysas just thinking about it as you were talking.
No.About the value of the title.
No the title is in the little boy's terms the morning of his life and it happened in the morning and I—I used the word "race" as—to the—the exuberation— the exuberance of—of speed.
That to him was—that life at that age never does go slow.
When it begins to slow up you get bored.
It's always at top speed.
Nadn't thought of it in reference to humanity.
It just—it was his—his title his terms.Sir do you find it best that—once you get an idea to sit right down and write it or is it best to think it over and sort of let it gelfter you have been properly snake-bit with writing you don't have any spare time to sit down and think something over.
You get one idea while you're in the middle of—of getting another one down and the new—new idea has simply got to—got to take its chance unless it's as they say so hot at the moment that you will put down what you're doing to take it up.
But probably some sort of a—you might call it protective coloration that that idea don't come into the mind as new until subconsciously it has been hovered over fohile.
That it has begun to take its final shape before it ever comes into the conscious mind as an idea to write.
That you don't know where you got it you don't know how long you've had it.
That it—it was an—was an egg or—oen that's been sitting over that single egg for the—whatever length of time it takes to hatch the thing out before it comes into the conscious mind.
Yes sir.When you think of stories gap in tape like this did iay before it's really worth being developed.
That's all right if it has buhink that the primary purpose otory is first to be fun to the bloke writing it and the second to be fun to the bloke reading it.
That if—if it haessage that's all right.
The message don't do any harm.
But you're doing something that you like to do.
It's fun to do and if it's done well—if it was true it's done the best you can in a—a—a moving dramatic form it will please who reads it.
The message is incidental.
I—that is what I'm trying to say ion't think that—that any good story ever came because someone was trying to tell somebodessage with it.
If he's goessage that worries him the best thing is to tell that message in the simplest sort of way instead of trying to inventory to fit it because if the characters are true to themselves sometimes they might not believe in that message.
They may take charge of the story so the message is—is you might say a—a byproduct of something that had—had no concern with the message.I was just wondering if you have this—havtory then your purpose is more producing something that's enjoyable to be read but if it haheme in it in order to focus on the theme in order to make the theme as—as fully developehould think you'd have to keep that in mind keep what the—  Inderstand you right in that case the message would be one of the craftsman's tools.Yes sir.
That—well that's—that's perfectly validessage is one of his tools just like the rhetoric just like the punctuation.
That's quite valid but you don't writtory just to show your versatility with your tools.
You writtory to tell about people man in his constant struggle with his own heart with the hearts of others or with his environment.
It's—it's man in—in the ageless eternal struggles which we inherit and we go through as though they've never happened before shown fooment iramatic instant of—of the furious motion of being alive.
That's all any story is.
You can catch this fluidity which is—is human life and you focuight on it and you stop it long enough for people to be able to see it.Someone once remarked—I don't know wheread it—he said none of your characters ever made any conscious choice between good and evil.
Does that seem to yorue statement or not don't—don't remember my characters that well.
audience laughteould have to read  again.
I—san't dispute that nor—nor agree with iton't believould agree with it offhand though but I—I can't cite you an instance.
Yes sir.Sir in order to bood writer oolished writer do you consider that writing must bull-time job or do you feel like you can have some of other business interest on the outside and also devote your spare time to writing sayrobably you're better off if you have other interests and maybe other compulsions.
I—I think that—that the writer even though he—he don't—can't spend all his time writing he is never free of that demon which he invited or which took possession of him to live with him for the rest of his life that he's always writing.
He may not carry—carrotebook with him but he's listening to terms of speech.
He's struck by what people do to wonder why he did that why he didn't do the other.
In that sense he never stops beinriter but he can't spend all his time at it because he might—well probably would if he spent too much time at it he'd begin to write nonsense balderdash.
It's always good never to write yourself out at any time.
It's fine to need to stop and always stop as the book says while you're looking good.
Never write yourself to the end ohapter or the end—end ohought.
Always stop just before you get there to have something to start on next time.
And if you have something else to do going to schoohole new job or raisinamily or babysitting then you are anxious and eager enough to get back to the writing to where you will come at witew head of steam.Sir when you find that if you were going to say puessage oheme iertain story that you would probably sit down and alter say perhaps the realistic events of what you've seen in order to make it tell this message or the theme of which would alter the story say the hunter story there merely to put acrosertain point.
You can't do that.
Once the characters are realized they—they take charge and they're going to do only what they're going to do.
You can't do anything about it.In other words first comes the story and then ....  That's right.
That's right.
That is most of—oan's private beliefs will appear sooner or later in his behavior his actions.
The messaghink comes from the story not from the author's private beliefs but from the—the characters in his story that the author is not telling yoessage but the characters in the story have told you something that they believe is necessary that you know.
Because no author can be responsible for the ideas of his characters.
Yes sir.Do you think that one of the functions of writing is to not teach but to make the writer himself enjoy the life that he leads aside from his writing more fullyaave that again please sir?
Do you think that writing makes—helps the writer or not—doesn't help him but that the gap in tape they can learn more themselves and know more and enjoy life more fullyhey do learn more as they write buoubt if they write just to teach themselves.
They write because it's fun because some—well fun iad term too but something has—has struck them as being so true and so important and so moving that they've got to do something with it and of course he does learn.
He learns all the time he's writing just as the carpenter learns all the time he's building houses or stables but the writer writes because he is—he is on fire with something an idea oharacter that seems to him so true so moving that it won't let him rest.
He's got to put it down.
That's whaean by fun.
It's—fun is the wrong word.
It's—passion ietter word.
Yes sir.as wondering if your impression of the University has changed since the impressions you had before you came here?
Sion't know how many of your characters but one at least in Requiem foun went here and so you must have had some impression of the University itself anonder if it's changed since you've actually been hereot reallychool with a—with a—a tradition of behavior certain standards which—which the undergraduates follow whether from choice or whether they are compelled to by the general atmosphere of the school changes only as—as life itself changes.
If you—if you mean by change if there're more automobiles parked around the Lawn and the Grounds than there were thirty years ago yes the place has changed.
But they are ephemeral changes.
They're not too significant and don't have too much to do with—with the—what's basic in this school achool anoubt that there ever will be great changes.
The great changing would have to come from some loosening of the—of the strictures which control it the tenets not—not so much the—the bylaws but the unspoken—the moral tenets that this university functions within accepts not because it's compelled but because they like it or it may have—they may have found that that's the most practical.
Yes sir.Sir you saielieve last year that The Sound and the Fury was your best effort atoryas wondering if you have tried to use that narrative method again in other works would if the story I'm working at requires ithink the story compels its own style treat extent that the writer don't need to bother too much about style.
If he's bothering about style then he's—he's going to write precious emptiness not necessarily nonsense but there'll—it'll be quite beautiful and quite pleasing to the ear but there won't be much content in it.
That the—the story the characters they—they have their own laws which the—the writer simply must follow.
That they will elect what they're going to do and what they won't do.
The story itself elects its own style.
The writer's job is merely to—to pick and choose between two more or less identical anecdotes.
You won't need but one of them and he will chose the one that seems to him the most tragic or the funniest but the—the characters themselves are saying "This is whaill do or whaon't do."
If the writer is going to force and compel them he's destroyed them that what he will wind up with is—is something that—that he—he himself will—will never be satisfied with will get no pleasure from and as I've said before the—the end in writing is not for success and not really for glory.
It's because it's fun.
Of course any man likes to think of—of glory but he would write if he knew that he would never be able to put his name on it.
Who was first?
Yes sielieve you are.I think that the hour is upon't think the bells are working this morning.
Thank you very much indeed appreciate your being here ever so much.
... not onlrivilege but everybody's right to find mankind and love mankind and be accepted into mankind and he couldn't because mankind aried to say in my paper in Holden's terms wasn't there anymore.
Yes sir.Sir mankind as you say wasn't there.
That—in this time well it isn't.
The problem is ... in things before these would you say like Hamlet or times past these same conditions point—man has always struggled to find mankind and often he can't do it.
It's sort of universal.
Except it's only now in history that—that man has been compelled into groups that there was no way for him to exist unless he belonged troup that everybody has to belong troup.
If it'onion norade union nouild—of course they existed five hundred years ago—but now everybody—a teacher has got to belong troup.
It's—it's got to bhi Beta Kappa badge or got to be an income tax bracket or if nothing else aaid it's how many installments he still owes on his icebox or his car that nobody belongs to himself anymore.
He belongs tinance company oroup or an organization.
If he don't there's no place for him.Would you believe that this system—it seems to me that this iertain class of people and it may prevail because we have television.
We have certain standardizations.
But I—I still think there are as many individuals growing up now as there were in times before.ould like to think so.
I'm afraid though that it takes so much oan's time to be an individual now that he don't have very much left be a—a poet.
how doean who works ihewing gum factory in Detroit communicate witan who shepherds sheep in Algeria?
Let's say that they're both simple pensive men and you put them together.
This is the man-to-man confrontation that you speak of.
On what terms can they communicatet's almost impossible because the only way two people can communicate is to meet one another in—in quieton't think they can do it over any artificial means of—of communication like radio or—or telephone.
They've got to meet face-to-face because onlery small part of communication is from speech and how a—a man in Detroit and an Algerian shepherd can—can meeon't know but all they need to do to communicate is to meet in solitude and peachink.
To sit on the same sand hill together fohile.
But the pressure is against that that people mustn't do that.
They must function through committees with slogans and catch phrases the polysyllabic abstractions that really mean nothing.Don't you think nowadays that possibly there arreat many individuals whom—whom you don't recognize as individuals because they don't—don't seem to be doing anything and that's where they are individuals—they're not belonging?
They're not necessarily worrying about the next ... hope soope there arot of them....on't know very many of them that are—that are free of the pressure to belong to something.
There may be someould like to—to know that there arreat many of them.Welhould think that probably in—in the teaching world in universities and colleges there might be more than elsewhere.
Would you disagree with thatould say that there would be.
That is the—the best the happiest place for the man to be an individual is in college.You're saying the solution is talk to everybodyes.I'd like to suggest that this talk has been profoundly true aecalhite paper ... if you'll examine earlier propaganda you will find an appeal to the individual the individual by the millions very much to the individual as he sits iazaar in Baghdad or ... or in Calcutta in his own language ... as for one individual to another that is wherhink that they have their big success.
Yes sir but—but ain't most of that telling the individual something?
It's not saying to the individual "Talk to me."
It's saying "Listen to me."
That's the trouble with all propaganda.No sir it is not iay contradict thathink the African is very much invited to talk and the proof of it that's he talking today in Ghana.
Welertainly hope you're right.Anould say that your mass man ireation of western civilizationon't think he exists in Indiaust say ... individual ...of the individual which is probably so intense.
There agaias very much struckouldn't help wondering whether all this about the howling and the hardship of the present generation couldn't be found very much more profoundly if you look at the lives of the poets and ... the lives of Dickens and the hardships .... Aren't we merely basing ourselves upon the Cadillac standard?
He doesn't have any ideals.
Isn't that the point I'm trying to make that our culture is—is founded on the Cadillac ideal?
Yes that's whergree with you.... to inform you how ... howl ... juxtaposed to the academicuppose .... Now my point is that these are extremes of the arts.
One is the—the breaking away which is not true ... howl not speech anuxtapose this to the academic poets.
Anhink we used the term a—jushrill shriek.
Now this is not speech.
Speech is somewhere in the middle.
Yes that's rightgree with that.You're not breaking it up and you're not holding it back but you're comfortablehink our culture is accustomed ... extremes ... Perhaps it's waiting for the poet in the middle before it starts talking and talking.
... background of the San Francisco poets.
They seem to get together iroup and play music and generally carouse while they create.
Anas wondering how this would fit in with your ideas that the artist is an individual.
Can they be individuals when they're creating arouph I'm sure he can.
His—his pursuits in his spare time wouldn't have to do with his—his attitude toward his own freedom as freedom is no good to you if you can't—it's worth nothing if—if you can't relinquish it now and then use it.
The only way you can test that you've got it is to see how far it will go.Caay one more thinges sir.The poets in San Francisco are unlearned.
They've not read the greats—they've not read their predecessors in literature and they resist any kind of learning and it seems to me all the great poets all the great writers have read and know their style and these don't .... Anould say that the academic poets are over-read and have no vitality.
These people have all the vitality and no control and the others are over-controlled.
Where are the middle people ... in the poems thaead and the novelead?
Sir do you think economically hard times could aid creative energy?
People can't go on buying pricey cars and living ... and it seems likittle more aggressive spirit.
In times like this if there wereal recession it might not harm some of the individualism that seems to die if there is plenty of everything.
Do you agree at all don't know whether that would—would produce any—any more and better poetry.
More people might buy what poetry is for sale.
That—that is if they couldn't buy the Cadillacs—and nobody likes to sit down and just think.
He has to do something with himself so maybe they may even buy poetry at the last but it wouldn't make people write any better poetrhink.
A. K. Daviour—your—your speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize was one of the most encouraging things that I've ever heard said in my very long lifetime.
You haven't changed your mind have youo sir.
A. K. Davis You don't think that this generation likormer neighbor of yours said is poor in spirit and common as hell do youo sion't think so.
A. K. Davis Well then—then what do you mean in relation to what you said at that time when you accepted your Nobel Prizeell I—I mean whahoughaid.
I—I'm sorry.
Maybon't understand your question.
A. K. Davis Well I—I'm sure it's my fault but it seems to me now that you seem rather hopeless about the—the prevalence of individuality and the—the human spirit and that in that speech you seemed to have stressed the importance of that by strongly agreeing.
Do you feel the world has changed now to the point where it's all but impossible for individualism to prevailo sir.
I've never said thatas simply pointing out to—to the young writer whaelieve was his trouble.
He knows there's something wrong but maybe he hasn't seen this thaas simply trying to show him what a—a little more experience than he—has suggested to me may be the trouble.
That he himself without knowing it is—is constricted too much by the regimentation necessary for a—a nation to sacrifice as much as nations have to to oppose two antipathetic ideologies that I'm convinced that the poet can do his bit toward supporting the manufacture of—of A-bombs and things like that if that is necessary and can still bood poet.
I'm convinced too that if anyone is to bring us to some sense it's not going to be the people that make the A-bombs nor sell the Cadillacs.
It'll be the poets the artists.an't resist asking one more questioropos of what you've just said—interests me considerably.
If the poet must not address himself to the world to try to change it but must write what's in him what he knows then is the benefit which the poet is to give to the world to come from the world's recognition of what he writes or is he to find some point in between writing in and of himself exclusively and writing what the world needs for him to write?
I'm not sure whether—where—wheroet must fall in that dilemma if it iilemma.till don't think he needs to worry about that.
If—if he is writing of the—the struggles of the human heart in conflict with itself or with others or with its environment he'll be writing in the—the recognizable terms which people have all met in their own private dilemmas.Well if—if it's his own—suppose if it's his own private world that he knows which happens to be unlike the real world but is quite real to him.
How is that to—how is the world to interpret thatell we would say that—that every man has what you have called his own private world but if he does not write about that in recognizable terms in terms which everybody else can apply to his and her own private world then it's not going to be of much value.
That he's got to write of his own private world in universal terms.
That's whaean by the—the eternal simple few verities which man's heart anguishes over.
They are recognizable by anyone who wouldn't recognize the—the—the culture and the economy of—of 1950.
He would have to translate that into his own terms but these verities thapeak of the—the—the simple truth would be recognized by—by anyone of any age of any time whichink is the reason that—that—the—the good music good poetry the good pictures don't have any date because anyone recognizes them.
They're still true what they were talking about no matter what costume they wore.
isn't it possible though that these eternal verities may be spoken of in certain styles addressed to contemporaries and yet misunderstood and therefore neglected?
Aren't there—aren't there writers who are addressed by their contemporary audiences who are totally neglected because of the—of the manner in which they were addressed and not because of the subject matter don't know sir.
It's seemed that gap in tape in recognizable terms—there'll always be somebody to read itean by recognizable terms you can writong treatise about honesty and your audience—will go to sleep iew minutes but if you write about honesty in some dramatic form in terms of recognizable people then the audience will stay awake to see what happened to them whether they got away with be—being dishonest or whether honesty paid.
That's whaean by recognizable terms.
That if you write in a—ianguage an essay people won't listen because it's not familiar but if—if you write in terms of people in motion they will listen and they will learn.
The—the poet can talk to people that way when they wouldn't listen to him at all if he wrotpeech or an essay.How do you feel about The Hamlet being made intovie and did you work on the script of thato I'm nooving picture man and don't probably—don't really care for pictures.
Oee one occasionally buupposon't take moving pictures very seriously.
Maybe they come at the wrong time of day  to go to see.
And they make too much noise too.
I'd rather sit down witook and read it than to listen to something.
but that is the great medium it seems for the artist .... Shakespeare ... Shakespeare who speaks to all people—to the people who can't read.
That's right.
What's against it is it costs too much money.
It's impossible for one man to have the—the camera and the film and to make exactly what he thinks is right and true to make.
You can do that witollar's worth of paper anickel pencil but you can't do with that film.
It costs too much.You can writad novel but you can't makad movie.
did you say that the highest form of endeavors is not to sit back and say "Welon't bart of this" but it's saying that "It's is sad and I'm going to do something about it."
How—how do you reconcile this to what you say the fact that the writer shouldn't care whether he makes any effect on societyh that's easy because you can't—the—the one thing that—that man can do for eight houray is work but you can't work even longer than eight houray.
You can beformer but you don't need to boet at the same time.
You'll boet for eight hours and beformer for eight hours and sleep for eight hours.
It's—there's—there's no reason why they should ever conflict.
If you try to beformer anoet at the same time then you're going to be writing propaganda which stops being poetry.I—I disagree with you.
Some of the greatest poetry in the English literature is didactic.
It's teaching preaching poetryean Wordsworth was one of thehinkhink we underrate the—the—the didactic element in poetry.
Wouldn't you have liked his poetry if he were not preaching?
Yes buhink that—I think we need to come again to an appreciation of his didacticismhink it'ime again almost for preaching poetry.
Well that's—...  Well mayboet could be—be happier beinreacher anoet too buhink that—that he's primarily eitheoet or primarily eithereacher and if he's got to try to be both at the same time one is going to suffer.Welon't knowike your Fable very much and admire it areat great novel buhink it'a terrible sermorightening sermonse the word terrible as you do.
It wasn't intended to bermon.
That is it waatter of indifference to the writer whether it waermon or not.
He was simply writing about something that seemed—seemed true and moving to him.Sir last spring you spoke of the work of—when you were asked of William Styron and Shelby Foote and Warren Eyster as young writers whose novels elicited some approval from you.
They seemed promising writers.
Do you think that the fact that they as far anow write—do not write about cities gives them more oossibility for showing the human heart in conflict with itself would say that iity the—to belong to conform thapoke of is more apparent not necessarily more prevalent but there's—there's—there's more space between you and—and the wall of pressure in the country where there is—is not so much fewer people but—but fewer of the constant symptoms of—of belonging of being grouped of being pressedon't think that their work is any better because they—they—they write about the countryhink that to me that work too reflects the same thing that—that the characters don't participate in that free almost jolly ordinary moil and seethe of simple people that the characters of—of Dickens every time they stepped outdoors they were in it.
They were right in the middle of the human race.
Every simple act they performed they were in the middle of mankind the human race which the characters in the books today don't seem to be able to attain.You'd feel that Salinger for example just hasn't created enough characters who seem to bart of this big human race.
There isn't just a—there just isn't enough for Holden Caulfield to come in contact with before he can get anywheree couldn't get to them.
He tried.
There was the chance with the professor that understood him and—and could have helped him but there he had—right in there he had run into a—a preconception which was foisted on him that every man if—if—if he's not happily married he must be homosexual.
That's the—the pressure to belong troup to be typed that you can't be yourself you've got to—to belong to something.
If he—if he ran into two people that should have beeart of the—of the moil and seethe of—of simple people whicpoke about that was the prostitute and the pimp and the only point they met on was that—that shabby five-dollar bill that there was no human contact otherwise even when the—the man hit him it might have beeoor swinging into him.
There's nothing human in it.
The only human contact he could reach was with his little sister who was too young to—to see that she knew that he was in trouble but she had no conception of—of what the anguish and trouble wasYes sir.Before you spoke about when you gave your list of the great masters ... you seemed to end with Twain and with James and then later when you spoke about the subject of our cycle of decadence you named the years 1912 '13 '14.
Do you think it may be possible that there ioincidence between that time and the beginning of the cycle if indeed there is one and the works of such great European masters as Joyce Proust Mann Gide the people who seem to deal with fiction in an interiorizing way as opposed to the outdoor world of such earlier masters that you mentioned like Fielding Smollett would say that the—the people who had matured as writers by 1910 had the same concept of—of the world of humanity as the people two hundred years ago but since 1910 the—the young man who had no actual experience of that world had no concept of it that he had—has been born intifferent world that the world he is born into is the world that is—is enclosed by all the—the subtle pressure to belong to something.
Whatever the—the reason that—that everyone must belong to something is—is not the point thaas trying to make.
The fact is that it seems to me it is there that if—if you're going to be an eccentric the first thing you know you're going to be lumped witroup of eccentrics.But isn't it just as greatly pronounced in the 19th century novels both English and French Dickens' Great Expectations or Stendhal's Red and the Black the heroes in both of those novels?
Aren't they betrayed once they tried to touch out or reach out and touch societyes sir but the society they touched was a—a moil and seethe of simple people.
When the—the character nowadays reaches out to touch something he—he touches a—a formula.
He touches something that—that's called "labor" or called "people's democracy" or "social welfare" or "communism" or "anti-communism" or "Citizen's Council."
He's don't touch jusoil and seethe of simple people functioning on man's own simple desires to—to have—have fun at no cost or as little cost as possible.
... That's the significance of it.Yes sir.Perhaps some of the others of you havuestion now about The Unvanquished or Sartorises sir.Sir I'd like to know what you consider the significance of the sprig of verbena from—on young Bayard's pillow in The Unvanquished at the end of the book.
That too—that young man was the—it signified his stepmother who was alsoung woman who believed in the qualities which his background his tradition had taught him to believan should have to be brave to never brook an injury nor an insult.
He had associated verbena with her because she had said that was part of his awareness of her that that was the only flower she liked because that was one that smelled stronger than courage and horses.
She had assumed that after his father'd been killed he would take the pistols and go and—and kill his father's killer.
He decided that there'd been enough killing but he couldn't run so he went unarmed and faced the man who had killed his father and so he won the moral victory which took courage too and though his stepmother couldn't condone the fact that he had not drawn blood for blood an eye for an eye she did realize that that took courage too maybe more than to have gone armed.
And that was her way of saying "This is not my—my way of solving this but what you did was brave too and this is the way I'll say goodbye" so she lefprig of verbena where he could find it.
That was—took the place of the note she might have written him.
She wasn't the sort to have writteote.
Yes sir.Why did you draw up this young Negro boy Ringo to be the smarter of the twohat was because—that's something thahinave seen in his race.
That is not all of his race are that smart and—and that clever but the ones that are smart and clever have never hahance to because of the condition in which the white man wants to hold the Negro.
This one he had freedom.
He had the same background environment that the white boy had and so he hahance for what genius what talent he had to—to flower without being challenged.
That won't happen with—with any Negro just like it won't happen with any white boy but occasionally there would be the Negrhink with talent and capacity to be clever if he had the chance toYes sir.Were there—I am sure there must have beeumber of Confederate veterans around when you were growing up aoy.
Did you talk to them hear their reminiscences and—esemember a—a lot of themas five six seven years old around 190 anld enough to—to understand to listen.
They didn't talk so much about that warad got that from the—from the maiden spinster aunts which had never surrendered.
Buan remember the—the old men and they would get out the old shabby grey uniforms and get out the old battle flag on Decoration Memorial Day.
Yeemember any number of them.
But it was the—the aunts the women that had never given up.
I—my aunt she liked to go to picture shows.
They had Gone with the Wind in the theatre at home and she went to see it and as soon as Sherman came on the screen she got up and left.
She had paid good money to go there but she wasn't going to sit and look at Sherman.
audience laughteat—toward the end of The Unvanquished Aunt Jenny tells Bayard aboulockade runner she knew who used to have the toast "No bloody moon."
Was that so that he could get through the—  Yes yes.
That's right.—ships undetected.
And she passes it on to Bayard as kind oood luck thing no doubtes.Well why does he say it to George Wyatt the next day?onder.
He meets him downtown and is supposed to avenge his father.
Is he just being humorouso by that time in his concept that had begun—had become a—a gesture of—of well-wishing.
It's almost like "Here's hoping" or—or "May you have an ace in the hole" that sort of thing.
It had no connection any more with moonlight jusay of—of saying "May you—may you win this gambit."
"May there be nothing—may the gods be good to you."
Yes sir.
how deep was Ab Snopes into Grumby's business and what jobs do you think he did for Grumbyrobably not very deep.
He waanger-on.
He was sort oackal.
Grumby iay was a—waion.
He was a—a shabby sorry lion but Ab Snopes was never anything buackal anmagine that Grumby would have had little patience with—with Ab Snopes.
Ab Snopes hung around the outskirts of the kill to get what scraps might be left.
But nobody would have depended on Ab Snopes because Ab probably wouldn't have stuck wouldn't have held together when the pinch came.
Yes sir.What is the significance of the Snopes in this book and his relationship to the Benbow girl in Sartoris?
Do you remembernopes was clerk in the bank at that time.
He saw that girl on the street and he began to write her letters—letters probably anonymous letters containing indecent proposals.Was there any special significance that that was supposed to illustrate ...ell only to illustrate that—that there was not any sort of shoddiness and sorriness and baseness that some Snopes wasn't capable of.
Not all of them would be capable of all baseness but any baseness you could think of there would always be a—one Snopes's footprint there.
Yes sir.I'd like to know exactly what the train signified since the white boy had—had seen the train and the colored one hadn't.
It meant the old train out may have been ruined by the Yankees.
Was that supposed to be some significant thing ruined by the white people themselveso only that the white boy had told the nigger boy about trains and the nigger boy had never seen one and he wanted to see one too.
It was just unlucky that the time the Negro boy got to see the train it—it couldn't have been running fast and fine and free.
It was involved in war and destruction at that time that the Negro boy didn't get to see the splendid gallant train which white boy had seen in peacetimehink there was no significance to the fact that the Negro boy had to see a—a ruined train but only that he was unlucky in that he couldn't see that aetter time but the fact that—that he—that's his own cleverness to cope with—with his condition his environment that everain that might not have been as fine and beautiful as the one the white boy saw but he had seerain too and the Negro boy could probably have imagined what that train would look like if it hadn't been in war.
The white boy might not have been able to.Welas wondering if you had meant any significance concerning freedom any—any tangible thingo that's the sort of symbolism which—which the reader must bring to—to any—anything he readsean must.
He can't help it.
Because you—you read just as you write out of your own experience of observation imagination and actual seeing and hearing.
You bring that to what you read and so the symbolism probably must be inherent in the work though the writer does not necessarily need to have said "Now I'm going to puittle symbolism right here" because you write from the same thing you read from is the general fund of—of our recordean by "our" all—all Americans all the English-speaking people or we'll say all Christian people read and write from the same warehouse of—of experience in the terms of culture.
Seader an erudite reader can find more symbolism than an illiterate reader can simply because the erudite bloke has read more.
He has more to cast back to and say "Oh yes that's what this is."
The—the—the illiterate one would say "Yes this is true" but he sees no connection with—with anything that somebody wrote 500 years ago or that someone—some psychiatrist or psychologist has—has formulated to explain behavior which the erudite man knows.
But the symbolism I'm sure are the—the—the symbols of the symbolism are inherent in the work if they came from the same culture as the reader and the writer.
Yes sir.Sir in—in Sartoris it appears that when Bayard young Bayard in the wreck after his grandfather is killed that he commitind of cowardly act by running away.
Why didn't he go back and be more or less brave as the—to have—to show his courage like the Sartoris family always has instead of running away expect that that one of the twins really wasn't brave and knew it.
His dead brother was the—the braveean capable of—of the sort of rash recklessness which—which passes for physical courage.
That the one that survived not only had—had suffered the—the psychotic injury of having loswin but also he would have to say to himself "The best one of us died.
The brave one died."
And he no longer wanted to live actually.
He came—came back home but he probably had no good reason to—to live or maybe he was—would have to salve himself by saying "Well whether I'm brave or not it doesn't matter anon't care."
It may—Sir I'm curious about your handling of the dialogue in your writing.
Your—your style is somewhat distinctive and yet when you weld them together in the dialogue there doesn't appear to be any separation ... one seems to flow out of the other.
When you try to recreate the words that this character says to what extent do you enter your own idiosyncrasies into his speech or to what extent do you go to keep him pure and write the way he actually saysow that iuestion that probably no writer can answer for the reason that the writer himself never knows just how much from which of the three sources he has drawn to create his character.
That is the—the three sources are observation experience and imagination.
Of course he's got to write some of himself into—to whatever he writes whether he wants to or not.
In a—a certain sense anything anyone writes is biographical in that it must come out of his own personal private experience or imagination or observationhink that he lets his people speak in the—the terms in their own individual terms.
He does not deliberately try to make them express his own ideas unless he and they agree.
You might say that—that any writer is saying the writer is not responsible for any of the ideas these people express.
They are—the characters are not his own.
He tries not to let his own thoughts color what his characters see and do.
It—I expect it's impossible to keep them completely pure or they would lack the—the breath of life emotion which makes you want to read what they say and what they do.
But the writer is certainly trying to—to submerge relinquish himself completely into that character at the moment when he is transcribing what that character said and did.
coulsuestion of interest to many historians also interested in literature?
You spoke of the three-fold fund experience observation and imagination.
When you write about—as you did in The Unvanquished—the period of the Reconstruction do you find that works of historians about Reconstruction in Mississippi are useful or do they just clutter the issue and deaden the imagination?
But to build up your knowledge of that period do you—did you find that you went naturally to historical works on the period or was that at all useful that sort of things far anoave never done one page of research in my life.
Alsoubt if I've ever forgotten anythinver read too.
The researcid was—was coincidental to the facas doing something which was fun that is reading.
I've never gone to these things to—for information.
It was becausas—was reading about people in motion alive in the conflict of the heart with itself or with its fellows or with its environment.
That what researceaead exactly ao fiction because it's—it's people man in motion and the writer aay never forgets that.
He stores it away.
He has no morals.
And when he needs it he reaches around and he drags it out  and if it don't quite fit what he wants to say he'll probably change it jusittle.elieve you had another question sir.Yes siras thinking of one.
In The Unvanquished up until the time—I imagine—I think the two boys were about twelve years old.
You played up the fact that the white boy was one little step ahead of the colored boy at that time by having seen something that the other hadn't.
Then afterwards the colored boy took command of the situation when they started their reselling of the mules anas wondering if you thought that the colored person was coming into the front or into more power or initiative in that day and ageelan't sayhink that—that anyone regardless of—of color—No let me—let me start over againould say that the color had nothing to do with how much any individual any human being can take advantage of—of his advantages.
In this case that—that—the Negro boy was faster on his feet than the white boy.
That is because maybe the Negro boy had brought something from Africa when he had to be pretty quick on his feet in the rain forest to stay alive.
The white boy haradition of an aristocracy in which God had protected him.
He could afford to bittle slow though if they were put in ... gap in tape foeconon't think anyone could say that the Negro boy would've been faster then than the white boy.
Once the white boy realized that the old secure condition was gone then he had to be pretty quick on his feet too.
Though my thought is that—that everybody can't handle freedom if he had it but that anyone should have the chance the freedom to see just how good he can be and whether he's white or black.
That he won't fail because he is black.
That he will fail because it was in—inherent in him not to cope with freedom.
He whether he was white or black had no business with freedom.
Yes sir.Sir in Sartoris you sort of skipped over one generation of the Sartoris family between the old Bayard and the young Bayard.
Is there any reason for thatramatically yes.
Dramatically there was no—well the twins' father didn't havtory.
He came at a—a period in history which—which in this country people thought of and think of now aeaceful one.
That it was an optimistic one.
Nothing was happening.
There would be little brush-fire wars that nobody paid much attention to.
The country was growing.
The time of—of travail and struggle where the hero came into his own had passed.
From '70 on to 1912 '14 nothing happened to Americans to speak of and this John Sartoris the father lived in that time when there was nothing that brought the issue to him to be—be brave and strong or dramatic—well call it dramatic not brave but dramatic.
Nothing happened to him.
But he had to be there for the simple continuity of the family.
And yet if you thought otory some time about that—that father something that he could have done you would havight to—to give it to him wouldn't youure he's already on record and he's—he's in—in my stable tooan run him any timind— Sires sir.Sir did any of the three manuscripts you burned relate to that periodo no.
None of them did.
The Unvanquished was published originally aeries of short storieelieve and then revised foovel form.
When you were writing those short stories did you have the idea in mind that these would makovel eventually or did they just appear after they appeared in short story form to fit together so naturally that it was necessary to makovel out of them saw them aong seriesad never thought of it in—in terms oovel exactlyealized that they would be too episodic to be whaonsidereovel shought of them aeries of stories.
That wheot into the first onould see two more but by the time I'd finished the first onaw that it was going further than that.
And then when I'd finished the fourth onad postulated too many questions thaad to answer for my own satisfaction.
So the others had to be—the other three or two whichever it was had to be written then.Has Hollywood ever expressed any interest in these storieses they—they bought the book.
That iunny story too.
oducer named David Selznick bought Gone with the Wind.
M-G-M wanted to make it and he—he wouldn't let M-G-M make it.
He wanted to use Gable who was under contract to M-G-M in it and they—they wouldn't let him have Gable and he wouldn't let them have Gone with the Wind.
So they bought my book and told him that—that if he didn't let them make Gone with the Wind they were going to makone with the Wind of their own.
They had no intention of makinoving picture out of my book.
And so Selznick let them make the picture.
Yes sir.I'm interested in—in both Sartoris and in The Unvanquished that were—the lines that were always talking about smell.
There was lines about the smell of the mules and about the smell of the verbena and people playing tennis were smelly laughter and—and things like thatondered why you did that all the way through both books.an't say unless maybe smell is—is one of my sharper senses.
Maybe it's sharper than sight.
There's no reason.
There's certainly no deliberate intent.
That'art of the environment which the writer is trying to describe.
That to me is—is as noticeable as the ear which hears the—the turns of speech which could be simply because that'harper sense with me than maybe sight or hearing.Might it also be that it's just—just important in setting the picture and—and you didn't have to talk about the weather.
You could just say the—that the smell and the smell would convey light and heat and things like thates naturally because the writer is trying to—to describe the—the particular instance the scene so well that anyone will understand it will see it and feel it too and the writer whose sense of smell is pretty sharp will use smell.
Someone who had constant catarrh and couldn't smell at all wouldn't do it but he wouldn't think of smell because he hadn't—never heard of smell you might say.
That he uses—the writer uses all his senses to creatcene in which the reader will say "Yes that's sonderstandan see thatave seen that too" or if the sense of smell is strong "Yes I've smelled that too."
That's not really a—a trick at all.
It's—the end is the same as though it werrick.
It's simply the writer is using all his—all the pressure all the gasoline and gas he's got to create a—a scene which the reader will understand and feel too Yes sir.Do you still write poetry at allo siad sense enough to learn young  thaould bad poet and stopped.
To me there're no degrees of poetry.
It's either good poetry or it's trash anouldn't write good poetry suit.Sir are you currently writinovelo writer ever really quits.
He might think that he's takinacation from it but he's—he's not.
It's—it's stewing and going on up here all the time and—and when he runs out of something to do and gets bored he'll sit down and go to work on it.
Aet old I—it's easier and easier for me not to write but in time I'll get bored and I'll go back to work again or the demon will begin to spur it out.Sir especially in The Unvanquished and also in your other novels there seems to beneral loosening of tradition oort of rapid progress coming forth.
What characters in general what types of people in your novels do you think respond best to the progresshey respond in different ways.
The Snopes have responded to it and have coped with it pretty wellould say the one that is least troubled by change was the sewing-machine agent Ratliff that he had accepted a—a change in culturhange in environment and he has suffered no anguish no grief from it.
In—for that reason he's in favor of change because it's motion and it's the world as he knows it and he's—he's never one to say "I—I wisad been borundred years ago" or "I'm sorras born now and couldn't have put it ofundred years."
Ratliff will take what's now and do the best he can with it because he is—possesses what you might call a—a moral spiritual eupepsia that his digestion is good all right nothing alarms him.When you speak oan in motion do you think that that person who moves along with it is apt to be the most successful or—ell he—he might have more peace.
He may not be more successful.
Ban in motioeant simply that motion is life that—that man if he's alive he is in motion and whether you like where he's going or not your only alternative is stasis or death and the choice which Ratliff had no trouble making is "Either—eitheill take this or nothing anould prefer this to nothing that I'd prefer breathing to not breathing."
But success—it would depend on what anyone means by success.
Maybe Ratliff never used that term to himself at all but probably he was in own lights quite successful.
That is he wanted—  ... he was in his own lights quite successful.
That is he wanted no more than he knew within his capacity he would have that he was going to enjoy what he saw and heard and was going to livong time in peace because he had accepted coped with environment without trying to manipulate environment for his own aggrandizement as Snopes did.
Yes sir.What was the purpose of the episode about the—the wart or the mole on Old Bayard's face?
He went to see Lucius Peabody and Dr. Alford and somebody else.
He went to see three doctors ....  Well that wasn't too important.
It really proved nothing.
It—it simply stipulated a—a true fact that the—the old people that have traditions of going out in the garden to geew weeds and stewing in tobacco juice can perform miracles of cure when all the doctors with their fine pharmacopoeia and all the rest of the gadgets sometimes fail and that's always a—a little amusing to me wheee somebody that will—will go to the—what the trained doctor would calitch doctor and geittle piece of salve that will cure something that the doctor or the surgeon himself failed to do anything with.
That by optimisean that man himself is somehow indestructible that he don't need education and training at all that—even he can cope with illiteracy.
He can cope with science that all the atom bombs and things like that are not going to destroy man that he will find some little thing in his kitchen garden to stew down that will efface the atom bomb from threatean figuratively speaking.
Yes sir.Sir did you have any reason for having Old Bayard live so much longer than all the other Sartoriseso.
Probably the only reason was a—a dramatic and technical oneimply needed him.
As soon aidn't need him anymorot rid of him.
Yes sir.In The Unvanquished the theory of the McCaslins that people belong to the land is that to represent the belief oeneral class of people at that time or was that just an individual case of ...t was—well not quite individual because there were more McCaslins in that county than that one family.
They didn't—well they might've represented a—a type the type that didn't have the—the education of the Sartorises and the Compsons but had some of the same traditions.
They were close enough to the land probably to havittle more toughness that none of the McCaslins MacCallums would have—have produced the—the—the Caddys and Quentins of The Sound and the Fury.
That they would've—have solved their problems would have faced their problems better than—than Compsons and maybe Sartorises did that no MacCallum would have—would have wreckear in which his grandfather died and then simply walked out of the scene.
Yes sir.This question is related.
Were Colonel Sartoris and your great-grandfather the Colonel Falkner—I mean—or how much did you—how much did you draw on Colonel Falkner to get the picture of Colonel Sartorishat's difficult to say.
That comes back to what we spoke of—the three sources the writer draws from and—anyself would have to stop and—and go page by page to see just how mucrew from family annals thaad listened to from these old undefeated spinster aunts that—that children of my time grew up with.
Probably well the—the similarity of raising of that infantry regiment that was—that was the same.
The—his death was about—was pretty close pretty close parallel.
But the rest of iould have to go through to—page by page and remember diear this or dimagine this?
Sionder what—if you intended to—to make us think was the future of the—the young—young baby John Sartoris would benow—or whether it's jusead between the lines buemember that Aunt Jenny said that when old Simon died that he was the last of the real Sartorises and then again Narcissa said that—when she wanted to change the name Aunt Jenny said "Well you'd better not.
He'll turn out to be one anyway."
So is there any prediction that you would make that he would turn out to be just like—as—as violent as all the rest or whether he would turn out to bew generationrobably he wouldn't be as violent as the othershink that what the old aunt meant was that—that these people were—were her kin and—and she would have to be on their side and have to see that all this was fine and gallant but that—that they were obsolete that the men the southern men were the ones that—that couldn't bear being—having lost the war.
The women were the ones that could bear it because they never had surrendered.
The men had given up and iense were—were dead and—and even generations later were seeking death.
And in her opinion the sooner this quality in the Sartoris men died out the better for Sartoris for the Sartoris clan race.
And she—probably she believed that—that this boy would have all the best of the Sartorises and none of the vicestoward the end of "An Odor of Verbena" she says to Bayard "Damn you Sartorises" even though she seems to approve of his not going out and getting revenge.
Is it some quality of heartlessness that she feels even in an act that she approves ofo no she loves these people and they have constantly—all of her life they have given her anguish and trouble.
That she can't help but love them and she believes in them not in what they do and they do these reckless completely self-centered things that have caused nothing but anguish and grief to all their womenfolk.
That's all that meant.
That she's proud of this boy but he too has done something unexpected that when she expects them to act like human beings they act like Sartorises then when she expects the next one to behave likartoris he behaves likimple human being  and she has no—will never have any peace from them.
That's all that meant.Yes sir.When the boy's aunt says "Go upstairs until this blows over.
It'll be all right" is she saying that because she just doesn't want him to get hurtes that's it.
That's—that's the woman—this is the last one.
And—and she knows that—that she expects him to go out and get himself shot because he'hild compared to this man and he wouldn't come out of a—ouel with—with this man and she's willing for him to boward just so he stays alive.
She knows that he's not going to do that.
But that's—that's—that's the woman.
She's been his mother.
She's telling him to do something that she herself probably wouldn't really want him to do.In that—that final section of The Unvanquished are you developinotion ohanging and developing tradition and that Bayard doesn't reject the whole tradition.
He keeps the honor and the courage but he rejects the—part of the old tradition and that—that is the vendetta.
Anondered if you—that if the sprig of verbena represented the old mechanical unchanging tradition that he was building from and rejecting partly but not altogetheroticed that you present that sprig of verbena as having the petals stamped out as if—as if bachineondered if—if you—in your mind that meant that this was the—the mechanical unchanging tradition that he was rejecting partly what he was growing away from but still keeping the—the honor and the courage.
No the verbena—the fact that sprig of verbena was alive was—was an accolade that the—the verbena even though it looked like it had been stamped out bachine and was traditional was still alive and there would be another one next year.
And that was an accolade of—of optimism too.
That she could have left a—a note scrawled on a—a piece of paper but that would have been dead paper and dead ink.
This was—was alivromise of—of renewal for next year.
Yes sir.Sir in the earlier chapters of The Unvanquished Colonel Sartoris is shown to bery brave man anery—could do all sorts of wonderful things and then in the last chapter he seems to be shown ilightly different light that he's not—not quite all these things that he appeared to be earlier.
Just what is your estimation of Colonel Sartoris aans a—a simple human man.
In the—the first stories in that book that was—was how this little boy saw him.
Later that little boy got older and—and had some perspective.
He could see that this man who had seemed incapable of—of weakness or evil was human too.
It wasn't that the—that Sartoris changed so much but the boy had changed could see more than he had seen at first.
The picture he had of him at first was someone that would be gone away fighting iar and then he'd come back foay or two and then be gone again the picture that his grandmother and his aunt and the servants that remained on the place had given him of what his father was.
Later when he got older and had some perspective and could—could see that—that war is—is not all that fine and—and gallant and that the people that engage in war probably are—are harmeittle by it too.
That he got a—he knew more about people about man about his grand—his father as he got older.
That was the reason not that Sartoris changed anymore than—than anyone changes by getting old and his arteries beginning to harden and his blood running slower.
His ideas becominittle more rigidwere there many girls in the war who went off like Drusilla rode astride and went with the troopsrobably not.
Probably she was the only one.
audience laughteean her prototype whoever it was thaot the idea for her fromaginead that somewhere too and just don't remember it.
Just like whoever wrote about the Iversons don't remember where he read that.
Yes sir.Is there any romantic attraction between Drusilla and the boy don't think so.
They were nearer akin in age buon't think sohink certainly Drusilla would have made no effort to—to bring that out in that boy because her husband older than she though he was was—was—was her—her knight.
He represented the best of—of the masculine to her to be ruthless and—and—and brave and to demand—to brook no insult to demand blood for blood that was exactly what she would have been if she'd beeoy.
And she probably never saw this boy other than someone who was close to her in age.
And he had never thought of her romanticallm quite sure because his father had—had stamped the whole tone of that household with his the father's importance that nobody would have dared tamper with his wife for instance.
And this boy that would have—might have been the one thing he would have shoan for for an insult to his father's wife not his mother necessarily but his father's wife because he would be preserving his father's honor.
let me thank you on behalf of the class and the visitors.
Well thank you.
... he was in his own lights quite successful.
That is he wanted no more than he knew within his capacity he would have that he was going to enjoy what he saw and heard and was going to livong time in peace because he had accepted coped with environment without trying to manipulate environment for his own aggrandizement as Snopes did.

And that was an accolade of—of optimism too.
That she could have left a—a note scrawled on a—a piece of paper but that would have been dead paper and dead ink.
This was—was alivromise of—of renewal for next year.
Yes sir.Sir in the earlier chapters of The Unvanquished Colonel Sartoris is shown to bery brave man anery—could do all sorts of wonderful things and then in the last chapter he seems to be shown ilightly different light that he's not—not quite all these things that he appeared to be earlier.
Just what is your estimation of Colonel Sartoris aans a—a simple human man.
In the—the first stories in that book that was—was how this little boy saw him.
Later that little boy got older and—and had some perspective.
He could see that this man who had seemed incapable of—of weakness or evil was human too.
It wasn't that the—that Sartoris changed so much but the boy had changed could see more than he had seen at first.
The picture he had of him at first was someone that would be gone away fighting iar and then he'd come back foay or two and then be gone again the picture that his grandmother and his aunt and the servants that remained on the place had given him of what his father was.
Later when he got older and had some perspective and could—could see that—that war is—is not all that fine and—and gallant and that the people that engage in war probably are—are harmeittle by it too.
That he got a—he knew more about people about man about his grand—his father as he got older.
That was the reason not that Sartoris changed anymore than—than anyone changes by getting old and his arteries beginning to harden and his blood running slower.
His ideas becominittle more rigidwere there many girls in the war who went off like Drusilla rode astride and went with the troopsrobably not.
Probably she was the only one.
audience laughteean her prototype whoever it was thaot the idea for her fromaginead that somewhere too and just don't remember it.
Just like whoever wrote about the Iversons don't remember where he read that.
Yes sir.Is there any romantic attraction between Drusilla and the boy don't think so.
They were nearer akin in age buon't think sohink certainly Drusilla would have made no effort to—to bring that out in that boy because her husband older than she though he was was—was—was her—her knight.
He represented the best of—of the masculine to her to be ruthless and—and—and brave and to demand—to brook no insult to demand blood for blood that was exactly what she would have been if she'd beeoy.
And she probably never saw this boy other than someone who was close to her in age.
And he had never thought of her romanticallm quite sure because his father had—had stamped the whole tone of that household with his the father's importance that nobody would have dared tamper with his wife for instance.
And this boy that would have—might have been the one thing he would have shoan for for an insult to his father's wife not his mother necessarily but his father's wife because he would be preserving his father's honor.
let me thank you on behalf of the class and the visitors.
Well thank you.
... if you mean by that—that's true of any family whether they are southern or not.
They cling to an obsolescence whatever that obsolescence might be yes.
And people havendency to—to remember what was pleasant and the unpleasant part of that vanishes as memory attenuates so that all you remember is the happy part of it and the instinct is to go back to that happy part.
You don't always remember that if you went back to the happy part you'd have to go through with the—with the unhappy part again too.
That's partly clinging to the happy past.
It's partlack of—of something present to occupy.
Everybody iense needub of washing and the people like the Sartorises and Compsons they don't havub of washing anymore.
Yes sir.In the—the story and your discussion are you equating having education to book learningook learning is—iart of education that—I would say iad to define education I'd say it'apacity to increase always to—to know more tomorrow than you knew today no matter where you get it from.
You might get it from—from playing poker or from farming or from going to school or from fighting.
Book learning of course iart of education but book learning to my notion does not constitute education.
It's—nothing is of any value if you can't use it.
If you can't use it not so much to make other people better tomorrow but to make yourselittle better tomorrow than you are to know more to bittle wiser to be more sure of—of your own capacity to—to be honorable and brave.... you concede that some education happens in the schoolh yes.
Oh yes.So do you think then by going to school—if he wanted to just hunt and—and farm do you think he might have gone into something else now that he has gone to school and learned ... doubt it.
He would have—have found out that—what  Ernest tried to tell him that to have the—the—the right the privilege to do what you want foortnight in the year you've got to do something for the other 351 days that maybe you won't like that—that you have got to teach yourself or be taught discipline or nothing that you ever acquire will be any good to you if you don't have discipline.
And to go to school at his age was mainly the discipline of something that must be done.Do you mean the process of him going to school is—actually in the subjects that he would be taught he probably wouldn't learn anything that would be practical as far as him makiniving or—  That's right.
Not until he found out for instance that he liked to read.
Once you discover you like to read then nobody really needs to worry about your book education anymore.
You tend to that yourself unless you want to specialize in something.
when you put that title down "Race at Morning" did you think of the appropriateness of that title on really various levels.
That is the fact that the "morning" is the boy.
The "race" means human race as well as the literal race in the hunt?
You can interpret that title in various waysas just thinking about it as you were talking.
No.About the value of the title.
No the title is in the little boy's terms the morning of his life and it happened in the morning and I—I used the word "race" as—to the—the exuberation— the exuberance of—of speed.
That to him was—that life at that age never does go slow.
When it begins to slow up you get bored.
It's always at top speed.
Nadn't thought of it in reference to humanity.
It just—it was his—his title his terms.Sir do you find it best that—once you get an idea to sit right down and write it or is it best to think it over and sort of let it gelfter you have been properly snake-bit with writing you don't have any spare time to sit down and think something over.
You get one idea while you're in the middle of—of getting another one down and the new—new idea has simply got to—got to take its chance unless it's as they say so hot at the moment that you will put down what you're doing to take it up.
But probably some sort of a—you might call it protective coloration that that idea don't come into the mind as new until subconsciously it has been hovered over fohile.
That it has begun to take its final shape before it ever comes into the conscious mind as an idea to write.
That you don't know where you got it you don't know how long you've had it.
That it—it was an—was an egg or—oen that's been sitting over that single egg for the—whatever length of time it takes to hatch the thing out before it comes into the conscious mind.
Yes sir.When you think of stories gap in tape like this did iay before it's really worth being developed.
That's all right if it has buhink that the primary purpose otory is first to be fun to the bloke writing it and the second to be fun to the bloke reading it.
That if—if it haessage that's all right.
The message don't do any harm.
But you're doing something that you like to do.
It's fun to do and if it's done well—if it was true it's done the best you can in a—a—a moving dramatic form it will please who reads it.
The message is incidental.
I—that is what I'm trying to say ion't think that—that any good story ever came because someone was trying to tell somebodessage with it.
If he's goessage that worries him the best thing is to tell that message in the simplest sort of way instead of trying to inventory to fit it because if the characters are true to themselves sometimes they might not believe in that message.
They may take charge of the story so the message is—is you might say a—a byproduct of something that had—had no concern with the message.I was just wondering if you have this—havtory then your purpose is more producing something that's enjoyable to be read but if it haheme in it in order to focus on the theme in order to make the theme as—as fully developehould think you'd have to keep that in mind keep what the—  Inderstand you right in that case the message would be one of the craftsman's tools.Yes sir.
That—well that's—that's perfectly validessage is one of his tools just like the rhetoric just like the punctuation.
That's quite valid but you don't writtory just to show your versatility with your tools.
You writtory to tell about people man in his constant struggle with his own heart with the hearts of others or with his environment.
It's—it's man in—in the ageless eternal struggles which we inherit and we go through as though they've never happened before shown fooment iramatic instant of—of the furious motion of being alive.
That's all any story is.
You can catch this fluidity which is—is human life and you focuight on it and you stop it long enough for people to be able to see it.Someone once remarked—I don't know wheread it—he said none of your characters ever made any conscious choice between good and evil.
Does that seem to yorue statement or not don't—don't remember my characters that well.
audience laughteould have to read  again.
I—san't dispute that nor—nor agree with iton't believould agree with it offhand though but I—I can't cite you an instance.
Yes sir.Sir in order to bood writer oolished writer do you consider that writing must bull-time job or do you feel like you can have some of other business interest on the outside and also devote your spare time to writing sayrobably you're better off if you have other interests and maybe other compulsions.
I—I think that—that the writer even though he—he don't—can't spend all his time writing he is never free of that demon which he invited or which took possession of him to live with him for the rest of his life that he's always writing.
He may not carry—carrotebook with him but he's listening to terms of speech.
He's struck by what people do to wonder why he did that why he didn't do the other.
In that sense he never stops beinriter but he can't spend all his time at it because he might—well probably would if he spent too much time at it he'd begin to write nonsense balderdash.
It's always good never to write yourself out at any time.
It's fine to need to stop and always stop as the book says while you're looking good.
Never write yourself to the end ohapter or the end—end ohought.
Always stop just before you get there to have something to start on next time.
And if you have something else to do going to schoohole new job or raisinamily or babysitting then you are anxious and eager enough to get back to the writing to where you will come at witew head of steam.Sir when you find that if you were going to say puessage oheme iertain story that you would probably sit down and alter say perhaps the realistic events of what you've seen in order to make it tell this message or the theme of which would alter the story say the hunter story there merely to put acrosertain point.
You can't do that.
Once the characters are realized they—they take charge and they're going to do only what they're going to do.
You can't do anything about it.In other words first comes the story and then ....  That's right.
That's right.
That is most of—oan's private beliefs will appear sooner or later in his behavior his actions.
The messaghink comes from the story not from the author's private beliefs but from the—the characters in his story that the author is not telling yoessage but the characters in the story have told you something that they believe is necessary that you know.
Because no author can be responsible for the ideas of his characters.
Yes sir.Do you think that one of the functions of writing is to not teach but to make the writer himself enjoy the life that he leads aside from his writing more fullyaave that again please sir?
Do you think that writing makes—helps the writer or not—doesn't help him but that the gap in tape they can learn more themselves and know more and enjoy life more fullyhey do learn more as they write buoubt if they write just to teach themselves.
They write because it's fun because some—well fun iad term too but something has—has struck them as being so true and so important and so moving that they've got to do something with it and of course he does learn.
He learns all the time he's writing just as the carpenter learns all the time he's building houses or stables but the writer writes because he is—he is on fire with something an idea oharacter that seems to him so true so moving that it won't let him rest.
He's got to put it down.
That's whaean by fun.
It's—fun is the wrong word.
It's—passion ietter word.
Yes sir.as wondering if your impression of the University has changed since the impressions you had before you came here?
Sion't know how many of your characters but one at least in Requiem foun went here and so you must have had some impression of the University itself anonder if it's changed since you've actually been hereot reallychool with a—with a—a tradition of behavior certain standards which—which the undergraduates follow whether from choice or whether they are compelled to by the general atmosphere of the school changes only as—as life itself changes.
If you—if you mean by change if there're more automobiles parked around the Lawn and the Grounds than there were thirty years ago yes the place has changed.
But they are ephemeral changes.
They're not too significant and don't have too much to do with—with the—what's basic in this school achool anoubt that there ever will be great changes.
The great changing would have to come from some loosening of the—of the strictures which control it the tenets not—not so much the—the bylaws but the unspoken—the moral tenets that this university functions within accepts not because it's compelled but because they like it or it may have—they may have found that that's the most practical.
Yes sir.Sir you saielieve last year that The Sound and the Fury was your best effort atoryas wondering if you have tried to use that narrative method again in other works would if the story I'm working at requires ithink the story compels its own style treat extent that the writer don't need to bother too much about style.
If he's bothering about style then he's—he's going to write precious emptiness not necessarily nonsense but there'll—it'll be quite beautiful and quite pleasing to the ear but there won't be much content in it.
That the—the story the characters they—they have their own laws which the—the writer simply must follow.
That they will elect what they're going to do and what they won't do.
The story itself elects its own style.
The writer's job is merely to—to pick and choose between two more or less identical anecdotes.
You won't need but one of them and he will chose the one that seems to him the most tragic or the funniest but the—the characters themselves are saying "This is whaill do or whaon't do."
If the writer is going to force and compel them he's destroyed them that what he will wind up with is—is something that—that he—he himself will—will never be satisfied with will get no pleasure from and as I've said before the—the end in writing is not for success and not really for glory.
It's because it's fun.
Of course any man likes to think of—of glory but he would write if he knew that he would never be able to put his name on it.
Who was first?
Yes sielieve you are.I think that the hour is upon't think the bells are working this morning.
Thank you very much indeed appreciate your being here ever so much.
... not onlrivilege but everybody's right to find mankind and love mankind and be accepted into mankind and he couldn't because mankind aried to say in my paper in Holden's terms wasn't there anymore.
Yes sir.Sir mankind as you say wasn't there.
That—in this time well it isn't.
The problem is ... in things before these would you say like Hamlet or times past these same conditions point—man has always struggled to find mankind and often he can't do it.
It's sort of universal.
Except it's only now in history that—that man has been compelled into groups that there was no way for him to exist unless he belonged troup that everybody has to belong troup.
If it'onion norade union nouild—of course they existed five hundred years ago—but now everybody—a teacher has got to belong troup.
It's—it's got to bhi Beta Kappa badge or got to be an income tax bracket or if nothing else aaid it's how many installments he still owes on his icebox or his car that nobody belongs to himself anymore.
He belongs tinance company oroup or an organization.
If he don't there's no place for him.Would you believe that this system—it seems to me that this iertain class of people and it may prevail because we have television.
We have certain standardizations.
But I—I still think there are as many individuals growing up now as there were in times before.ould like to think so.
I'm afraid though that it takes so much oan's time to be an individual now that he don't have very much left be a—a poet.
how doean who works ihewing gum factory in Detroit communicate witan who shepherds sheep in Algeria?
Let's say that they're both simple pensive men and you put them together.
This is the man-to-man confrontation that you speak of.
On what terms can they communicatet's almost impossible because the only way two people can communicate is to meet one another in—in quieton't think they can do it over any artificial means of—of communication like radio or—or telephone.
They've got to meet face-to-face because onlery small part of communication is from speech and how a—a man in Detroit and an Algerian shepherd can—can meeon't know but all they need to do to communicate is to meet in solitude and peachink.
To sit on the same sand hill together fohile.
But the pressure is against that that people mustn't do that.
They must function through committees with slogans and catch phrases the polysyllabic abstractions that really mean nothing.Don't you think nowadays that possibly there arreat many individuals whom—whom you don't recognize as individuals because they don't—don't seem to be doing anything and that's where they are individuals—they're not belonging?
They're not necessarily worrying about the next ... hope soope there arot of them....on't know very many of them that are—that are free of the pressure to belong to something.
There may be someould like to—to know that there arreat many of them.Welhould think that probably in—in the teaching world in universities and colleges there might be more than elsewhere.
Would you disagree with thatould say that there would be.
That is the—the best the happiest place for the man to be an individual is in college.You're saying the solution is talk to everybodyes.I'd like to suggest that this talk has been profoundly true aecalhite paper ... if you'll examine earlier propaganda you will find an appeal to the individual the individual by the millions very much to the individual as he sits iazaar in Baghdad or ... or in Calcutta in his own language ... as for one individual to another that is wherhink that they have their big success.
Yes sir but—but ain't most of that telling the individual something?
It's not saying to the individual "Talk to me."
It's saying "Listen to me."
That's the trouble with all propaganda.No sir it is not iay contradict thathink the African is very much invited to talk and the proof of it that's he talking today in Ghana.
Welertainly hope you're right.Anould say that your mass man ireation of western civilizationon't think he exists in Indiaust say ... individual ...of the individual which is probably so intense.
There agaias very much struckouldn't help wondering whether all this about the howling and the hardship of the present generation couldn't be found very much more profoundly if you look at the lives of the poets and ... the lives of Dickens and the hardships .... Aren't we merely basing ourselves upon the Cadillac standard?
He doesn't have any ideals.
Isn't that the point I'm trying to make that our culture is—is founded on the Cadillac ideal?
Yes that's whergree with you.... to inform you how ... howl ... juxtaposed to the academicuppose .... Now my point is that these are extremes of the arts.
One is the—the breaking away which is not true ... howl not speech anuxtapose this to the academic poets.
Anhink we used the term a—jushrill shriek.
Now this is not speech.
Speech is somewhere in the middle.
Yes that's rightgree with that.You're not breaking it up and you're not holding it back but you're comfortablehink our culture is accustomed ... extremes ... Perhaps it's waiting for the poet in the middle before it starts talking and talking.
... background of the San Francisco poets.
They seem to get together iroup and play music and generally carouse while they create.
Anas wondering how this would fit in with your ideas that the artist is an individual.
Can they be individuals when they're creating arouph I'm sure he can.
His—his pursuits in his spare time wouldn't have to do with his—his attitude toward his own freedom as freedom is no good to you if you can't—it's worth nothing if—if you can't relinquish it now and then use it.
The only way you can test that you've got it is to see how far it will go.Caay one more thinges sir.The poets in San Francisco are unlearned.
They've not read the greats—they've not read their predecessors in literature and they resist any kind of learning and it seems to me all the great poets all the great writers have read and know their style and these don't .... Anould say that the academic poets are over-read and have no vitality.
These people have all the vitality and no control and the others are over-controlled.
Where are the middle people ... in the poems thaead and the novelead?
Sir do you think economically hard times could aid creative energy?
People can't go on buying pricey cars and living ... and it seems likittle more aggressive spirit.
In times like this if there wereal recession it might not harm some of the individualism that seems to die if there is plenty of everything.
Do you agree at all don't know whether that would—would produce any—any more and better poetry.
More people might buy what poetry is for sale.
That—that is if they couldn't buy the Cadillacs—and nobody likes to sit down and just think.
He has to do something with himself so maybe they may even buy poetry at the last but it wouldn't make people write any better poetrhink.
A. K. Daviour—your—your speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize was one of the most encouraging things that I've ever heard said in my very long lifetime.
You haven't changed your mind have youo sir.
A. K. Davis You don't think that this generation likormer neighbor of yours said is poor in spirit and common as hell do youo sion't think so.
A. K. Davis Well then—then what do you mean in relation to what you said at that time when you accepted your Nobel Prizeell I—I mean whahoughaid.
I—I'm sorry.
Maybon't understand your question.
A. K. Davis Well I—I'm sure it's my fault but it seems to me now that you seem rather hopeless about the—the prevalence of individuality and the—the human spirit and that in that speech you seemed to have stressed the importance of that by strongly agreeing.
Do you feel the world has changed now to the point where it's all but impossible for individualism to prevailo sir.
I've never said thatas simply pointing out to—to the young writer whaelieve was his trouble.
He knows there's something wrong but maybe he hasn't seen this thaas simply trying to show him what a—a little more experience than he—has suggested to me may be the trouble.
That he himself without knowing it is—is constricted too much by the regimentation necessary for a—a nation to sacrifice as much as nations have to to oppose two antipathetic ideologies that I'm convinced that the poet can do his bit toward supporting the manufacture of—of A-bombs and things like that if that is necessary and can still bood poet.
I'm convinced too that if anyone is to bring us to some sense it's not going to be the people that make the A-bombs nor sell the Cadillacs.
It'll be the poets the artists.an't resist asking one more questioropos of what you've just said—interests me considerably.
If the poet must not address himself to the world to try to change it but must write what's in him what he knows then is the benefit which the poet is to give to the world to come from the world's recognition of what he writes or is he to find some point in between writing in and of himself exclusively and writing what the world needs for him to write?
I'm not sure whether—where—wheroet must fall in that dilemma if it iilemma.till don't think he needs to worry about that.
If—if he is writing of the—the struggles of the human heart in conflict with itself or with others or with its environment he'll be writing in the—the recognizable terms which people have all met in their own private dilemmas.Well if—if it's his own—suppose if it's his own private world that he knows which happens to be unlike the real world but is quite real to him.
How is that to—how is the world to interpret thatell we would say that—that every man has what you have called his own private world but if he does not write about that in recognizable terms in terms which everybody else can apply to his and her own private world then it's not going to be of much value.
That he's got to write of his own private world in universal terms.
That's whaean by the—the eternal simple few verities which man's heart anguishes over.
They are recognizable by anyone who wouldn't recognize the—the—the culture and the economy of—of 1950.
He would have to translate that into his own terms but these verities thapeak of the—the—the simple truth would be recognized by—by anyone of any age of any time whichink is the reason that—that—the—the good music good poetry the good pictures don't have any date because anyone recognizes them.
They're still true what they were talking about no matter what costume they wore.
isn't it possible though that these eternal verities may be spoken of in certain styles addressed to contemporaries and yet misunderstood and therefore neglected?
Aren't there—aren't there writers who are addressed by their contemporary audiences who are totally neglected because of the—of the manner in which they were addressed and not because of the subject matter don't know sir.
It's seemed that gap in tape in recognizable terms—there'll always be somebody to read itean by recognizable terms you can writong treatise about honesty and your audience—will go to sleep iew minutes but if you write about honesty in some dramatic form in terms of recognizable people then the audience will stay awake to see what happened to them whether they got away with be—being dishonest or whether honesty paid.
That's whaean by recognizable terms.
That if you write in a—ianguage an essay people won't listen because it's not familiar but if—if you write in terms of people in motion they will listen and they will learn.
The—the poet can talk to people that way when they wouldn't listen to him at all if he wrotpeech or an essay.How do you feel about The Hamlet being made intovie and did you work on the script of thato I'm nooving picture man and don't probably—don't really care for pictures.
Oee one occasionally buupposon't take moving pictures very seriously.
Maybe they come at the wrong time of day  to go to see.
And they make too much noise too.
I'd rather sit down witook and read it than to listen to something.
but that is the great medium it seems for the artist .... Shakespeare ... Shakespeare who speaks to all people—to the people who can't read.
That's right.
What's against it is it costs too much money.
It's impossible for one man to have the—the camera and the film and to make exactly what he thinks is right and true to make.
You can do that witollar's worth of paper anickel pencil but you can't do with that film.
It costs too much.You can writad novel but you can't makad movie.
did you say that the highest form of endeavors is not to sit back and say "Welon't bart of this" but it's saying that "It's is sad and I'm going to do something about it."
How—how do you reconcile this to what you say the fact that the writer shouldn't care whether he makes any effect on societyh that's easy because you can't—the—the one thing that—that man can do for eight houray is work but you can't work even longer than eight houray.
You can beformer but you don't need to boet at the same time.
You'll boet for eight hours and beformer for eight hours and sleep for eight hours.
It's—there's—there's no reason why they should ever conflict.
If you try to beformer anoet at the same time then you're going to be writing propaganda which stops being poetry.I—I disagree with you.
Some of the greatest poetry in the English literature is didactic.
It's teaching preaching poetryean Wordsworth was one of thehinkhink we underrate the—the—the didactic element in poetry.
Wouldn't you have liked his poetry if he were not preaching?
Yes buhink that—I think we need to come again to an appreciation of his didacticismhink it'ime again almost for preaching poetry.
Well that's—...  Well mayboet could be—be happier beinreacher anoet too buhink that—that he's primarily eitheoet or primarily eithereacher and if he's got to try to be both at the same time one is going to suffer.Welon't knowike your Fable very much and admire it areat great novel buhink it'a terrible sermorightening sermonse the word terrible as you do.
It wasn't intended to bermon.
That is it waatter of indifference to the writer whether it waermon or not.
He was simply writing about something that seemed—seemed true and moving to him.Sir last spring you spoke of the work of—when you were asked of William Styron and Shelby Foote and Warren Eyster as young writers whose novels elicited some approval from you.
They seemed promising writers.
Do you think that the fact that they as far anow write—do not write about cities gives them more oossibility for showing the human heart in conflict with itself would say that iity the—to belong to conform thapoke of is more apparent not necessarily more prevalent but there's—there's—there's more space between you and—and the wall of pressure in the country where there is—is not so much fewer people but—but fewer of the constant symptoms of—of belonging of being grouped of being pressedon't think that their work is any better because they—they—they write about the countryhink that to me that work too reflects the same thing that—that the characters don't participate in that free almost jolly ordinary moil and seethe of simple people that the characters of—of Dickens every time they stepped outdoors they were in it.
They were right in the middle of the human race.
Every simple act they performed they were in the middle of mankind the human race which the characters in the books today don't seem to be able to attain.You'd feel that Salinger for example just hasn't created enough characters who seem to bart of this big human race.
There isn't just a—there just isn't enough for Holden Caulfield to come in contact with before he can get anywheree couldn't get to them.
He tried.
There was the chance with the professor that understood him and—and could have helped him but there he had—right in there he had run into a—a preconception which was foisted on him that every man if—if—if he's not happily married he must be homosexual.
That's the—the pressure to belong troup to be typed that you can't be yourself you've got to—to belong to something.
If he—if he ran into two people that should have beeart of the—of the moil and seethe of—of simple people whicpoke about that was the prostitute and the pimp and the only point they met on was that—that shabby five-dollar bill that there was no human contact otherwise even when the—the man hit him it might have beeoor swinging into him.
There's nothing human in it.
The only human contact he could reach was with his little sister who was too young to—to see that she knew that he was in trouble but she had no conception of—of what the anguish and trouble wasYes sir.Before you spoke about when you gave your list of the great masters ... you seemed to end with Twain and with James and then later when you spoke about the subject of our cycle of decadence you named the years 1912 '13 '14.
Do you think it may be possible that there ioincidence between that time and the beginning of the cycle if indeed there is one and the works of such great European masters as Joyce Proust Mann Gide the people who seem to deal with fiction in an interiorizing way as opposed to the outdoor world of such earlier masters that you mentioned like Fielding Smollett would say that the—the people who had matured as writers by 1910 had the same concept of—of the world of humanity as the people two hundred years ago but since 1910 the—the young man who had no actual experience of that world had no concept of it that he had—has been born intifferent world that the world he is born into is the world that is—is enclosed by all the—the subtle pressure to belong to something.
Whatever the—the reason that—that everyone must belong to something is—is not the point thaas trying to make.
The fact is that it seems to me it is there that if—if you're going to be an eccentric the first thing you know you're going to be lumped witroup of eccentrics.But isn't it just as greatly pronounced in the 19th century novels both English and French Dickens' Great Expectations or Stendhal's Red and the Black the heroes in both of those novels?
Aren't they betrayed once they tried to touch out or reach out and touch societyes sir but the society they touched was a—a moil and seethe of simple people.
When the—the character nowadays reaches out to touch something he—he touches a—a formula.
He touches something that—that's called "labor" or called "people's democracy" or "social welfare" or "communism" or "anti-communism" or "Citizen's Council."
He's don't touch jusoil and seethe of simple people functioning on man's own simple desires to—to have—have fun at no cost or as little cost as possible.
... not onlrivilege but everybody's right to find mankind and love mankind and be accepted into mankind and he couldn't because mankind aried to say in my paper in Holden's terms wasn't there anymore.
Yes sir.Sir mankind as you say wasn't there.
That—in this time well it isn't.
The problem is ... in things before these would you say like Hamlet or times past these same conditions point—man has always struggled to find mankind and often he can't do it.
It's sort of universal.
Except it's only now in history that—that man has been compelled into groups that there was no way for him to exist unless he belonged troup that everybody has to belong troup.
If it'onion norade union nouild—of course they existed five hundred years ago—but now everybody—a teacher has got to belong troup.
It's—it's got to bhi Beta Kappa badge or got to be an income tax bracket or if nothing else aaid it's how many installments he still owes on his icebox or his car that nobody belongs to himself anymore.
He belongs tinance company oroup or an organization.
If he don't there's no place for him.Would you believe that this system—it seems to me that this iertain class of people and it may prevail because we have television.
We have certain standardizations.
But I—I still think there are as many individuals growing up now as there were in times before.ould like to think so.
I'm afraid though that it takes so much oan's time to be an individual now that he don't have very much left be a—a poet.
how doean who works ihewing gum factory in Detroit communicate witan who shepherds sheep in Algeria?
Let's say that they're both simple pensive men and you put them together.
This is the man-to-man confrontation that you speak of.
On what terms can they communicatet's almost impossible because the only way two people can communicate is to meet one another in—in quieton't think they can do it over any artificial means of—of communication like radio or—or telephone.
They've got to meet face-to-face because onlery small part of communication is from speech and how a—a man in Detroit and an Algerian shepherd can—can meeon't know but all they need to do to communicate is to meet in solitude and peachink.
To sit on the same sand hill together fohile.
But the pressure is against that that people mustn't do that.
They must function through committees with slogans and catch phrases the polysyllabic abstractions that really mean nothing.Don't you think nowadays that possibly there arreat many individuals whom—whom you don't recognize as individuals because they don't—don't seem to be doing anything and that's where they are individuals—they're not belonging?
They're not necessarily worrying about the next ... hope soope there arot of them....on't know very many of them that are—that are free of the pressure to belong to something.
There may be someould like to—to know that there arreat many of them.Welhould think that probably in—in the teaching world in universities and colleges there might be more than elsewhere.
Would you disagree with thatould say that there would be.
That is the—the best the happiest place for the man to be an individual is in college.You're saying the solution is talk to everybodyes.I'd like to suggest that this talk has been profoundly true aecalhite paper ... if you'll examine earlier propaganda you will find an appeal to the individual the individual by the millions very much to the individual as he sits iazaar in Baghdad or ... or in Calcutta in his own language ... as for one individual to another that is wherhink that they have their big success.
Yes sir but—but ain't most of that telling the individual something?
It's not saying to the individual "Talk to me."
It's saying "Listen to me."
That's the trouble with all propaganda.No sir it is not iay contradict thathink the African is very much invited to talk and the proof of it that's he talking today in Ghana.
Welertainly hope you're right.Anould say that your mass man ireation of western civilizationon't think he exists in Indiaust say ... individual ...of the individual which is probably so intense.
There agaias very much struckouldn't help wondering whether all this about the howling and the hardship of the present generation couldn't be found very much more profoundly if you look at the lives of the poets and ... the lives of Dickens and the hardships .... Aren't we merely basing ourselves upon the Cadillac standard?
He doesn't have any ideals.
Isn't that the point I'm trying to make that our culture is—is founded on the Cadillac ideal?
Yes that's whergree with you.... to inform you how ... howl ... juxtaposed to the academicuppose .... Now my point is that these are extremes of the arts.
One is the—the breaking away which is not true ... howl not speech anuxtapose this to the academic poets.
Anhink we used the term a—jushrill shriek.
Now this is not speech.
Speech is somewhere in the middle.
Yes that's rightgree with that.You're not breaking it up and you're not holding it back but you're comfortablehink our culture is accustomed ... extremes ... Perhaps it's waiting for the poet in the middle before it starts talking and talking.
... background of the San Francisco poets.
They seem to get together iroup and play music and generally carouse while they create.
Anas wondering how this would fit in with your ideas that the artist is an individual.
Can they be individuals when they're creating arouph I'm sure he can.
His—his pursuits in his spare time wouldn't have to do with his—his attitude toward his own freedom as freedom is no good to you if you can't—it's worth nothing if—if you can't relinquish it now and then use it.
The only way you can test that you've got it is to see how far it will go.Caay one more thinges sir.The poets in San Francisco are unlearned.
They've not read the greats—they've not read their predecessors in literature and they resist any kind of learning and it seems to me all the great poets all the great writers have read and know their style and these don't .... Anould say that the academic poets are over-read and have no vitality.
These people have all the vitality and no control and the others are over-controlled.
Where are the middle people ... in the poems thaead and the novelead?
Sir do you think economically hard times could aid creative energy?
People can't go on buying pricey cars and living ... and it seems likittle more aggressive spirit.
In times like this if there wereal recession it might not harm some of the individualism that seems to die if there is plenty of everything.
Do you agree at all don't know whether that would—would produce any—any more and better poetry.
More people might buy what poetry is for sale.
That—that is if they couldn't buy the Cadillacs—and nobody likes to sit down and just think.
He has to do something with himself so maybe they may even buy poetry at the last but it wouldn't make people write any better poetrhink.
A. K. Daviour—your—your speech of acceptance of the Nobel Prize was one of the most encouraging things that I've ever heard said in my very long lifetime.
You haven't changed your mind have youo sir.
A. K. Davis You don't think that this generation likormer neighbor of yours said is poor in spirit and common as hell do youo sion't think so.
A. K. Davis Well then—then what do you mean in relation to what you said at that time when you accepted your Nobel Prizeell I—I mean whahoughaid.
I—I'm sorry.
Maybon't understand your question.
A. K. Davis Well I—I'm sure it's my fault but it seems to me now that you seem rather hopeless about the—the prevalence of individuality and the—the human spirit and that in that speech you seemed to have stressed the importance of that by strongly agreeing.
Do you feel the world has changed now to the point where it's all but impossible for individualism to prevailo sir.
I've never said thatas simply pointing out to—to the young writer whaelieve was his trouble.
He knows there's something wrong but maybe he hasn't seen this thaas simply trying to show him what a—a little more experience than he—has suggested to me may be the trouble.
That he himself without knowing it is—is constricted too much by the regimentation necessary for a—a nation to sacrifice as much as nations have to to oppose two antipathetic ideologies that I'm convinced that the poet can do his bit toward supporting the manufacture of—of A-bombs and things like that if that is necessary and can still bood poet.
I'm convinced too that if anyone is to bring us to some sense it's not going to be the people that make the A-bombs nor sell the Cadillacs.
It'll be the poets the artists.an't resist asking one more questioropos of what you've just said—interests me considerably.
If the poet must not address himself to the world to try to change it but must write what's in him what he knows then is the benefit which the poet is to give to the world to come from the world's recognition of what he writes or is he to find some point in between writing in and of himself exclusively and writing what the world needs for him to write?
I'm not sure whether—where—wheroet must fall in that dilemma if it iilemma.till don't think he needs to worry about that.
If—if he is writing of the—the struggles of the human heart in conflict with itself or with others or with its environment he'll be writing in the—the recognizable terms which people have all met in their own private dilemmas.Well if—if it's his own—suppose if it's his own private world that he knows which happens to be unlike the real world but is quite real to him.
How is that to—how is the world to interpret thatell we would say that—that every man has what you have called his own private world but if he does not write about that in recognizable terms in terms which everybody else can apply to his and her own private world then it's not going to be of much value.
That he's got to write of his own private world in universal terms.
That's whaean by the—the eternal simple few verities which man's heart anguishes over.
They are recognizable by anyone who wouldn't recognize the—the—the culture and the economy of—of 1950.
He would have to translate that into his own terms but these verities thapeak of the—the—the simple truth would be recognized by—by anyone of any age of any time whichink is the reason that—that—the—the good music good poetry the good pictures don't have any date because anyone recognizes them.
They're still true what they were talking about no matter what costume they wore.
isn't it possible though that these eternal verities may be spoken of in certain styles addressed to contemporaries and yet misunderstood and therefore neglected?
Aren't there—aren't there writers who are addressed by their contemporary audiences who are totally neglected because of the—of the manner in which they were addressed and not because of the subject matter don't know sir.
It's seemed that gap in tape in recognizable terms—there'll always be somebody to read itean by recognizable terms you can writong treatise about honesty and your audience—will go to sleep iew minutes but if you write about honesty in some dramatic form in terms of recognizable people then the audience will stay awake to see what happened to them whether they got away with be—being dishonest or whether honesty paid.
That's whaean by recognizable terms.
That if you write in a—ianguage an essay people won't listen because it's not familiar but if—if you write in terms of people in motion they will listen and they will learn.
The—the poet can talk to people that way when they wouldn't listen to him at all if he wrotpeech or an essay.How do you feel about The Hamlet being made intovie and did you work on the script of thato I'm nooving picture man and don't probably—don't really care for pictures.
Oee one occasionally buupposon't take moving pictures very seriously.
Maybe they come at the wrong time of day  to go to see.
And they make too much noise too.
I'd rather sit down witook and read it than to listen to something.
but that is the great medium it seems for the artist .... Shakespeare ... Shakespeare who speaks to all people—to the people who can't read.
That's right.
What's against it is it costs too much money.
It's impossible for one man to have the—the camera and the film and to make exactly what he thinks is right and true to make.
You can do that witollar's worth of paper anickel pencil but you can't do with that film.
It costs too much.You can writad novel but you can't makad movie.
did you say that the highest form of endeavors is not to sit back and say "Welon't bart of this" but it's saying that "It's is sad and I'm going to do something about it."
How—how do you reconcile this to what you say the fact that the writer shouldn't care whether he makes any effect on societyh that's easy because you can't—the—the one thing that—that man can do for eight houray is work but you can't work even longer than eight houray.
You can beformer but you don't need to boet at the same time.
You'll boet for eight hours and beformer for eight hours and sleep for eight hours.
It's—there's—there's no reason why they should ever conflict.
If you try to beformer anoet at the same time then you're going to be writing propaganda which stops being poetry.I—I disagree with you.
Some of the greatest poetry in the English literature is didactic.
It's teaching preaching poetryean Wordsworth was one of thehinkhink we underrate the—the—the didactic element in poetry.
Wouldn't you have liked his poetry if he were not preaching?
Yes buhink that—I think we need to come again to an appreciation of his didacticismhink it'ime again almost for preaching poetry.
Well that's—...  Well mayboet could be—be happier beinreacher anoet too buhink that—that he's primarily eitheoet or primarily eithereacher and if he's got to try to be both at the same time one is going to suffer.Welon't knowike your Fable very much and admire it areat great novel buhink it'a terrible sermorightening sermonse the word terrible as you do.
It wasn't intended to bermon.
That is it waatter of indifference to the writer whether it waermon or not.
He was simply writing about something that seemed—seemed true and moving to him.Sir last spring you spoke of the work of—when you were asked of William Styron and Shelby Foote and Warren Eyster as young writers whose novels elicited some approval from you.
They seemed promising writers.
Do you think that the fact that they as far anow write—do not write about cities gives them more oossibility for showing the human heart in conflict with itself would say that iity the—to belong to conform thapoke of is more apparent not necessarily more prevalent but there's—there's—there's more space between you and—and the wall of pressure in the country where there is—is not so much fewer people but—but fewer of the constant symptoms of—of belonging of being grouped of being pressedon't think that their work is any better because they—they—they write about the countryhink that to me that work too reflects the same thing that—that the characters don't participate in that free almost jolly ordinary moil and seethe of simple people that the characters of—of Dickens every time they stepped outdoors they were in it.
They were right in the middle of the human race.
Every simple act they performed they were in the middle of mankind the human race which the characters in the books today don't seem to be able to attain.You'd feel that Salinger for example just hasn't created enough characters who seem to bart of this big human race.
There isn't just a—there just isn't enough for Holden Caulfield to come in contact with before he can get anywheree couldn't get to them.
He tried.
There was the chance with the professor that understood him and—and could have helped him but there he had—right in there he had run into a—a preconception which was foisted on him that every man if—if—if he's not happily married he must be homosexual.
That's the—the pressure to belong troup to be typed that you can't be yourself you've got to—to belong to something.
If he—if he ran into two people that should have beeart of the—of the moil and seethe of—of simple people whicpoke about that was the prostitute and the pimp and the only point they met on was that—that shabby five-dollar bill that there was no human contact otherwise even when the—the man hit him it might have beeoor swinging into him.
There's nothing human in it.
The only human contact he could reach was with his little sister who was too young to—to see that she knew that he was in trouble but she had no conception of—of what the anguish and trouble wasYes sir.Before you spoke about when you gave your list of the great masters ... you seemed to end with Twain and with James and then later when you spoke about the subject of our cycle of decadence you named the years 1912 '13 '14.
Do you think it may be possible that there ioincidence between that time and the beginning of the cycle if indeed there is one and the works of such great European masters as Joyce Proust Mann Gide the people who seem to deal with fiction in an interiorizing way as opposed to the outdoor world of such earlier masters that you mentioned like Fielding Smollett would say that the—the people who had matured as writers by 1910 had the same concept of—of the world of humanity as the people two hundred years ago but since 1910 the—the young man who had no actual experience of that world had no concept of it that he had—has been born intifferent world that the world he is born into is the world that is—is enclosed by all the—the subtle pressure to belong to something.
Whatever the—the reason that—that everyone must belong to something is—is not the point thaas trying to make.
The fact is that it seems to me it is there that if—if you're going to be an eccentric the first thing you know you're going to be lumped witroup of eccentrics.But isn't it just as greatly pronounced in the 19th century novels both English and French Dickens' Great Expectations or Stendhal's Red and the Black the heroes in both of those novels?
Aren't they betrayed once they tried to touch out or reach out and touch societyes sir but the society they touched was a—a moil and seethe of simple people.
When the—the character nowadays reaches out to touch something he—he touches a—a formula.
He touches something that—that's called "labor" or called "people's democracy" or "social welfare" or "communism" or "anti-communism" or "Citizen's Council."
He's don't touch jusoil and seethe of simple people functioning on man's own simple desires to—to have—have fun at no cost or as little cost as possible.
... he was in his own lights quite successful.
That is he wanted no more than he knew within his capacity he would have that he was going to enjoy what he saw and heard and was going to livong time in peace because he had accepted coped with environment without trying to manipulate environment for his own aggrandizement as Snopes did.
Yes sir.What was the purpose of the episode about the—the wart or the mole on Old Bayard's face?
He went to see Lucius Peabody and Dr. Alford and somebody else.
He went to see three doctors ....  Well that wasn't too important.
It really proved nothing.
It—it simply stipulated a—a true fact that the—the old people that have traditions of going out in the garden to geew weeds and stewing in tobacco juice can perform miracles of cure when all the doctors with their fine pharmacopoeia and all the rest of the gadgets sometimes fail and that's always a—a little amusing to me wheee somebody that will—will go to the—what the trained doctor would calitch doctor and geittle piece of salve that will cure something that the doctor or the surgeon himself failed to do anything with.
That by optimisean that man himself is somehow indestructible that he don't need education and training at all that—even he can cope with illiteracy.
He can cope with science that all the atom bombs and things like that are not going to destroy man that he will find some little thing in his kitchen garden to stew down that will efface the atom bomb from threatean figuratively speaking.
Yes sir.Sir did you have any reason for having Old Bayard live so much longer than all the other Sartoriseso.
Probably the only reason was a—a dramatic and technical oneimply needed him.
As soon aidn't need him anymorot rid of him.
Yes sir.In The Unvanquished the theory of the McCaslins that people belong to the land is that to represent the belief oeneral class of people at that time or was that just an individual case of ...t was—well not quite individual because there were more McCaslins in that county than that one family.
They didn't—well they might've represented a—a type the type that didn't have the—the education of the Sartorises and the Compsons but had some of the same traditions.
They were close enough to the land probably to havittle more toughness that none of the McCaslins MacCallums would have—have produced the—the—the Caddys and Quentins of The Sound and the Fury.
That they would've—have solved their problems would have faced their problems better than—than Compsons and maybe Sartorises did that no MacCallum would have—would have wreckear in which his grandfather died and then simply walked out of the scene.
Yes sir.This question is related.
Were Colonel Sartoris and your great-grandfather the Colonel Falkner—I mean—or how much did you—how much did you draw on Colonel Falkner to get the picture of Colonel Sartorishat's difficult to say.
That comes back to what we spoke of—the three sources the writer draws from and—anyself would have to stop and—and go page by page to see just how mucrew from family annals thaad listened to from these old undefeated spinster aunts that—that children of my time grew up with.
Probably well the—the similarity of raising of that infantry regiment that was—that was the same.
The—his death was about—was pretty close pretty close parallel.
But the rest of iould have to go through to—page by page and remember diear this or dimagine this?
Sionder what—if you intended to—to make us think was the future of the—the young—young baby John Sartoris would benow—or whether it's jusead between the lines buemember that Aunt Jenny said that when old Simon died that he was the last of the real Sartorises and then again Narcissa said that—when she wanted to change the name Aunt Jenny said "Well you'd better not.
He'll turn out to be one anyway."
So is there any prediction that you would make that he would turn out to be just like—as—as violent as all the rest or whether he would turn out to bew generationrobably he wouldn't be as violent as the othershink that what the old aunt meant was that—that these people were—were her kin and—and she would have to be on their side and have to see that all this was fine and gallant but that—that they were obsolete that the men the southern men were the ones that—that couldn't bear being—having lost the war.
The women were the ones that could bear it because they never had surrendered.
The men had given up and iense were—were dead and—and even generations later were seeking death.
And in her opinion the sooner this quality in the Sartoris men died out the better for Sartoris for the Sartoris clan race.
And she—probably she believed that—that this boy would have all the best of the Sartorises and none of the vicestoward the end of "An Odor of Verbena" she says to Bayard "Damn you Sartorises" even though she seems to approve of his not going out and getting revenge.
Is it some quality of heartlessness that she feels even in an act that she approves ofo no she loves these people and they have constantly—all of her life they have given her anguish and trouble.
That she can't help but love them and she believes in them not in what they do and they do these reckless completely self-centered things that have caused nothing but anguish and grief to all their womenfolk.
That's all that meant.
That she's proud of this boy but he too has done something unexpected that when she expects them to act like human beings they act like Sartorises then when she expects the next one to behave likartoris he behaves likimple human being  and she has no—will never have any peace from them.
That's all that meant.Yes sir.When the boy's aunt says "Go upstairs until this blows over.
It'll be all right" is she saying that because she just doesn't want him to get hurtes that's it.
That's—that's the woman—this is the last one.
And—and she knows that—that she expects him to go out and get himself shot because he'hild compared to this man and he wouldn't come out of a—ouel with—with this man and she's willing for him to boward just so he stays alive.
She knows that he's not going to do that.
But that's—that's—that's the woman.
She's been his mother.
She's telling him to do something that she herself probably wouldn't really want him to do.In that—that final section of The Unvanquished are you developinotion ohanging and developing tradition and that Bayard doesn't reject the whole tradition.
He keeps the honor and the courage but he rejects the—part of the old tradition and that—that is the vendetta.
Anondered if you—that if the sprig of verbena represented the old mechanical unchanging tradition that he was building from and rejecting partly but not altogetheroticed that you present that sprig of verbena as having the petals stamped out as if—as if bachineondered if—if you—in your mind that meant that this was the—the mechanical unchanging tradition that he was rejecting partly what he was growing away from but still keeping the—the honor and the courage.
No the verbena—the fact that sprig of verbena was alive was—was an accolade that the—the verbena even though it looked like it had been stamped out bachine and was traditional was still alive and there would be another one next year.
And that was an accolade of—of optimism too.
That she could have left a—a note scrawled on a—a piece of paper but that would have been dead paper and dead ink.
This was—was alivromise of—of renewal for next year.
Yes sir.Sir in the earlier chapters of The Unvanquished Colonel Sartoris is shown to bery brave man anery—could do all sorts of wonderful things and then in the last chapter he seems to be shown ilightly different light that he's not—not quite all these things that he appeared to be earlier.
Just what is your estimation of Colonel Sartoris aans a—a simple human man.
In the—the first stories in that book that was—was how this little boy saw him.
Later that little boy got older and—and had some perspective.
He could see that this man who had seemed incapable of—of weakness or evil was human too.
It wasn't that the—that Sartoris changed so much but the boy had changed could see more than he had seen at first.
The picture he had of him at first was someone that would be gone away fighting iar and then he'd come back foay or two and then be gone again the picture that his grandmother and his aunt and the servants that remained on the place had given him of what his father was.
Later when he got older and had some perspective and could—could see that—that war is—is not all that fine and—and gallant and that the people that engage in war probably are—are harmeittle by it too.
That he got a—he knew more about people about man about his grand—his father as he got older.
That was the reason not that Sartoris changed anymore than—than anyone changes by getting old and his arteries beginning to harden and his blood running slower.
His ideas becominittle more rigidwere there many girls in the war who went off like Drusilla rode astride and went with the troopsrobably not.
Probably she was the only one.
audience laughteean her prototype whoever it was thaot the idea for her fromaginead that somewhere too and just don't remember it.
Just like whoever wrote about the Iversons don't remember where he read that.
Yes sir.Is there any romantic attraction between Drusilla and the boy don't think so.
They were nearer akin in age buon't think sohink certainly Drusilla would have made no effort to—to bring that out in that boy because her husband older than she though he was was—was—was her—her knight.
He represented the best of—of the masculine to her to be ruthless and—and—and brave and to demand—to brook no insult to demand blood for blood that was exactly what she would have been if she'd beeoy.
And she probably never saw this boy other than someone who was close to her in age.
And he had never thought of her romanticallm quite sure because his father had—had stamped the whole tone of that household with his the father's importance that nobody would have dared tamper with his wife for instance.
And this boy that would have—might have been the one thing he would have shoan for for an insult to his father's wife not his mother necessarily but his father's wife because he would be preserving his father's honor.
let me thank you on behalf of the class and the visitors.
Well thank you.
Yes sir.Sir do you feel that the code of southern chivalry aroad moral way of life—broad basis fooral way of life was ever any more thaomantic dream or romantic ideal would say it was moral standards which man oveong period of time has found to be the best ones for himself and for everyone else which had got colored over witertain amount of romanticism and by certain it had come to be accepted—the romanticisean—as the most valid part of it.
That if you were romantic and gallant about it it didn't matter whether you were moral about it or not.
In that sense it—it was obsolescent and it'ood thing it is past but I'm convinced it was based on simple standards of—of good decent behavior which would be valid at any time.
Yes ma'am.Sir in "The Bear" is there any intended symbolism in Ike McCaslin taking on the profession of carpenter rather than store clerk or—or training—training in some other professionot symbolism on my part but probably on—on Ike's part in that the symbols which the writer puts into his work are the same symbols which the reader reads into it.
That is they come frohristian background.
It may be that Ike without stopping to rationalize it had deliberately assumed the symbol of—of Christ as a—a protest against an evil which he could not and would not condone.
He probably at that moment didn't have time to hunt around and say "Oh let's see what shalo?
I'll do something that Christ did."
He just said that "I will—I will becomarpenter."
He didn't go through the process of remembering—this was the symbology which he had inherited from the moment his—his mama taught him to say his prayers at night.
That waart of his—his literate background.
Yes sir.Was your purpose in "The Bear" to show the growing up ooy'm sorry would you—Was your purpose in "The Bear" to show the growing up omall boy?
How he grew upot the growing up but to shomall boy in conflict with the adult world which he would have to cope with.
That is he would have to bart of it and bood decent man or it would destroy him.
The—the small boy's world is a—iorld of innocence different from the adult world and his job is not in putting on inches and—and pounds.
It is simply in adapting himself morally and mentally to the adult world which he will have to bart of and that to me is—is one of the most interesting phases of man's struggle with the human dilemma is how the child grows up to cope with the adult world.
That to me is always interesting.
I've written about that lots of times for that reason.
It's how the child grows up and takes the—the knocks and the—the broken head and the skinned knuckles which he must take to becoman without being destroyed to bring into the adult world something of the—of the—the child's belief in some innate goodness or in decency or in courage in compassion.
Yes sir.Sir what do you find that makes people laugh would like to think it is—is joy in seeing that man really can survive his predicament.
His predicament is represented by the—the horrible the outrageous things that might happen to him yet he survives themould like to think that is what makes people laugh.
That it is not to see your—your fellowman slip oanana peel.
It's to see him slip on that banana peel and yet he survives.I've—I've heard you use the word "fun" several times anondered what is your idea of funell fun let's see ian define that.
In my own case it is to accomplish something which makes me feel good which may make somebody else feel good which won't hurt anybody.
Fun is to accomplish something which—whichought that perhapouldn't thaight not be brave enough or strong enough and theo it and I'm successfuluppose that everyone haifferent notion of what fun means san tell you only what it means to me and what I—wheay that to write for fun—it's to take man's dilemma the—the old familiar things in which there's nothing new and can't be anything new and by the—the light of my own experience and imagination anreat deal of hard work to make something which waittle different which wasn't here yesterday.
People write about the same stories because there's so few to write about.
But to take one human beings in the old familiar dilemma and predicament and by the imagination and the hard work to show them in some new interesting tragic or comical instance of the struggle within the dilemma.
That to me is fun.
But then so is gettinorse oveence thaasn't too sure he could get over or thaould still be on him fun.
Yes sir.Is this fun for you right now?
Yes.
Because I'm still making something which wasn't here yesterday dealing with—with human beings which are all of you and me and  McAleer in classrooms like this and then out of thiearittle more about people anould like to think that if some of you here want to write you may have learneittle more about how the writing gets done by someone who's been at it for thirty years.
It doesn't have to bery great new thing but something new might come out of it which is whaean by the fun of beinriter that anybody likes to havaptive audience to talk to probably.
Yes sir.You havreat knack for creating atmosphere.
Do you have to go about it consciously as Poe did it or does it just sort of come naturallyell there's—no writing comes naturally.
It'reat deal of concentration and hard work because one's standards are pretty high.
Anon't know there are probably times when the writer's got to scrabble around and invent create some atmosphere.
The other times when the situation he writes about the characters in it create the atmospherehink that every writer has sort otorehouse of what he has read what he has seen and smelled and heard and remembered.
After practice afteew years of writing he don't have to go through his files to get what he wants.
He sort of reaches one hand behind him and pulls out just what he needs for that moment.
Be something that he remembered the waird iree looked or sounded the way an apple tree smelled the way dirt looked that was just ploughed and suddenly he's putting that down before he has had time to say "Noeed to write about how an apple tree smells."
He's already done that.
Yes sir.
why do you think that there's so many good writers coming out of the South when there's so few people in the South that like to read literaturerobably because the South has the leisure which is the dream of any artisthink that the—the best thination can do if it really wants peace to devote itself to things of the mind and human spirit is to pick ouood rich nation declare war on them and let them—and let themselves get whippedhink after the North whipped us we had nothing to do but—but to write paint so we became writers.
The rest of the country was too busy supporting us.
Yes sir.Sir I'd like to ask a—a more specific question iay.
In "An Odor of Verbenaot the impression that Bayard had been rather anticipatiniolent death for his father for some time and was braced for it in certain respects.
Yet he still had this thing which he was fighting all the way through the story this "it" as he calls it "now it can begin again."
Exactly what was this feeling he had that he had to fight off before he could ...
He anticipated his father's violent death.
He also knew that his father represented an obsolescence.
That he did not want to participate in that obsolescence.
The—the anticipation of his father's death was not the—the—the anguish and grief of the loss.
It was the fact that he knew that when that happened this demand by all his tradition all his family his father's new wife and his aunt would demand that he takun in his turn and go and shed blood to pay for shed blood.
And that he was not going to do that.
That's why he hated the moment when his father would meet that end that violent end which the boy knew his father would meet.
That he would bariah to his tradition.
That he was not going to takun and avenge his father's blood.
And that was the "it" that he hated.
He didn't dread it.
He was going to accept his fate but that was what he meant.
That even the war had not settled that.
To any rational man the lost war should have settled that.
Men should have said "Well we tried blood and that didn't work so let's quit it."
But he knew that his father his father's generation would not do that.
And that he—he believed that he would be the only one he knew that would—would want to accept the future.
He probably didn't realize that there werot of other young southerners that were willing to accept the future.
He thought he would be alonariah to his country his tradition his family his blood everything.Buelieve that his Aunt Jenny who was of his father's generation thought it was all right.
Yes'm because aay women are adaptable.
It's men that—that cling to the old obsolete ways.
Women are adaptable eveoman as old as Aunt Jenny.
That she was—knew that she would apostate to all the family tradition but she was on the side of the future like the boy was.
Yes sir.Sir do you think Carson McCullers is going to be one of the leading writers in America todayhat's a—a question that—that is difficult for somebody like me to answer becauson't judge writers.
To me the book is the important thing.
It don't matter who wrote it.
And some people—anyone is going to have bad days when what he writes is not good.
The book is important.
Who wrote it means nothingould say that she's done some—some of the best work in our time buon't say that she is the best or the worst writer or number three or number ten.
Yes sir.As far as your writing is concerned what are your future plans for the next forty or fifty yearselntend to keep on writing longer than just forty or fifty years.
It'll take at leasundred to—for me to get done alant to write.
Anill probably spend that time still trying to make something new which wasn't here yesterday because writing is—is the one occupation which never bores you because it's—satiation is impossible.
You never can quite do what you want to do.
If what you want is money then some day you get all the money you want.
You can't do any more with it.
But you never get done with the writing because you never quite do it as good as you think if you live long enough you can do it tomorrow.
That's whaean by fun.
It's the one thing that you can do and never get bored with never get tired.
Yes sir.Are you writing anything on your stay up in Virginia think the writer is always cooking something up here.
As he gets older he don't like to sit down and put it on paper.
He'd rather loaf or talk to somebody or just sit and smoke.
When he gets bored tertain pitch he will face the—the job of putting it down on paper but he never stops inventing and weighing and discarding up here.Have you ever done any painting Not seriously.
Occasionally when something comes to hand or when they're painting barns and stables and things and I'll gemooth piece of plank annife or something to smear with and paint mules and people plowing and things like that but never serious.
Dogs in the woods.
That sort of thing.
Horses.Sielieve you tooalking tour through Europe foumber of days and I'm just wondering how much you got out of that in observing people and seeing things in Europerobablreat deal though it's impossible to sayhink the writer gets something from every experience.
He will store that away and at need maybe ten or fifteen or thirty years later he will find that he needs something that he got then.
He is omnivorous and amoral.
He will take everything he sees with no judgment no discretion.
Since that is the—the material that he works from.
But no writer can sahink just how much he got from what when.Sir I'd like to ask youestion about Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio.
In Winesburg Anderson refers to—almost every character that he refers to is tall.
That is Alice Hindman Elizabeth Willard and Wash Williams's wife.
Is there any reason for this using tall people is it some sort of symbolism or—t could be that that was his first book the first writing he did and probably more of—of his—his own subconscious wishes appeared in that than would have appeared if he had got in the—the habit of writing and discharging that young but he was getting along towards forty years old when he wrote that book.
He was a—a short man that probably all his boyhood had—had wished he were bigger so he could fight better defend himself.
It could be that that is the reason though it may be that he simply admired tall people whatever the reason that some people admire tall people.
But it's just possible it's because he himself was short.
When he was sitting behinable like this he looked likig man but when he stood up he wasn't.
Anhink that he maybe would have liked to have been more imposing looking.
At that time he didn't realize that probably it's—it's not how higan is.
It's what's in his face that makes him imposing looking.
Ladies and gentlemes generously with us once again.
On two levels one that came up last week wheoung Polish visitor to the United States came up to the fifth floor of Cabell Hall witranslatioolish translation of  's The Wild Palmsuppose it has some—emphasizes—or it was published because of the theme of the difficulty of love iapitalist society but it shows the—once again the extent of  's current influence.
On the other hanolleague  Blotner aatter of fact reports that at the—during the comprehensives last week an English major—one boy identified the novel The Town as simply "novel twentieth century by our own  ."
So we run between these two extremes of local pride and international pride.
Anhink that may set the tone for the kind of questions we are allowed to as.e.
anything.Would it be better itood up like this?
Yes sirYes sir.Is David Hogganbeck in "A Courtship" an ancestor of Boon Hogganbeck in "The Bear"es that would be Boon's grandfather probably.
1812 to—yes that would be Boon's grandfather.
Yes sir.
in Winesburg Ohio Sherwood Anderson haection in there on Jesse Bentley that doesn't seem connected with the rest of the book as much as the other chapters.
That is none of the people in there knew George Willard.
There's been criticism of this.
Would you care to comment on that as it stands—maybe your fourth section of "The Bear" seems to beaelation on the past to the present whereas—is there much as much oelationship in this section of Winesburg Ohio'm sure there was in  Anderson's concept of ithink the writer looks on his work as an entity that it has got to—to please him by its completeness its wholeness.
What seems extraneous to somebody else to him may seem completely necessary that without that even though it might have been—been out of—out of tune almost was necessary to the—the work ahole an entity.
And I'm sure that  Anderson felt that his book without that was not finished not complete.
That it wasn't intact.
Yes sir.
Malcolm Cowley has written that not one of your characters exercises the faculty of conscious choice between good and evil that they seem to be haunted obsessed and driven—or driven by some kind of destiny.
Do you think that'alid statementes it is quite valid in—in the sense that—that anyone who reads a—a book or story gives something to that—something of himself to that book or that story.
It takes that.
The—the—the man that wrote it offeroncept.
That is he offers his own opinion which is his own concept oundamental truth.
Someone else sees it sees the same fundamental truth but he adds something to it.
If the—the critic is—is intelligent is sympathetic and is quite honest of course his criticism even thougight not agree with it is valid.
Anhink the writer's not the one to say that it's wrong simply because he doesn't agree with it.
Cowley may be righton't think he is but I'm not the one to say that he's wrong just because we don't agree.
But at least he brought enough attention and sympathy to the book to havound or valid opinion of it which is certainly what the critic should do.
Not to write what the critic's own clients expect to hear from him the next time he reviewook but to give his concept oiece of worork of art.
Yes sir.Sir in Aay Dying do you conceive of Darl as having more than one reason for burning the barn where his—his mother's body is being stored for the nighte probably did.
Darl was mad.
His reasons are—would be completely valid reasons if you accept his premise.
It's like the—the man that—that sits on a—a plank full of tacks looks insane until you find out he thinks he's Gandhi.
Darl could have had our reasons and his own mad reasons for what he did.
Could have had any number of reasons.
The—the—the sane reason might be to—to effac.. but his own reasons we don't know what they might be because he was mad.
Yes sir.
some of the prose writers in this so-called San Francisco renaissance that's going on now feel that the novel form aype is archaic and that it won't make any progress until they can get rid of the discipline imposed by simple grammar punctuation the language in generalonder how you'd react to this idea of theirs.hink the—the manner the method is—is not too important.
The writer is simply trying to arrest in one dramatic moment an instant of man's struggle within the human dilemmahink that he should use whatever method seems the best to him to do that.
Buon't think that because he believes that—that his method is the best one that all other methods are bad.
Anhink that if anyone is going to waste his time trying to abolish the—the form of the novel then he's not going to get much good work done.
To use whatever form is—comes to hand that does his job.
If it'oving picture camera use that.
If he'd rather use paint use that.
If he'd rather—if he thinks he can do it better with sign language assuming that he can communicate with enough readers use thatmagine that any form is—is going to change buon't think that—that we will see the time when folks will get rid of grammar and punctuation.
Yes ma'am.You use the term human dilemma.
What do you describe auman dilemmahe environment in which man frail and fragile with all his impulses his lusts greeds also his conscience whatever it is that makes him want to be better than he is and makes him even when he's responsible for it hate the condition in which the weak suffer and anyone is hungry which will always occur.
That he would like to alter that.
He hasn't been able to so far yet he doesn't quit trying.
His dilemma is to—to arrange the world in which he lives in which he—and where he came without any—any choice intondition in which he can get the most for his money you might say.
His dilemma is his struggle with his own nature against his conscience.
Call that God or whatever you like.
But whatever it is that—that makes man want to be better than he is and that he is afraid he may be able to be.
That he wants to be braver than he is afraid he might be.
He wants to be more honest than he's afraid he might be able to be.
And he wants—wants peace.
He wants happiness what he calls happiness.
And his dilemma is his struggle and striving to get that.
Yes sir.I—in The Sound and the Furason Compson ... is one of your most memorable characters.
To me he is one of the meanest orneriest people whave ever conceived of.
Now if it's noersonal question have you ever known anyone who was anywhere near as mean and as hateful as Jason Compson hopaven't.
No writer worth his salt is going to believe that anybody can create better people than—than he can more villainous or more saintly.
And srefer to believe that there ain't anybody quite that bad becausould have lost the trick.
Yes sir.I have found thaumber of characters particularly in Absalom Absalom!
and The Sound and the Fury havreat obsession with time and through their conception of time which often tends—to define their characters.
In other words an obsession with the past or with the future or—or placing time altogether out of the ... as the sum of their characters their—their—their own characters to their own detriment.
And that Dilsey perhaps and Lena who approach time iyclical order and therefore have been able to make more order out of their lives.
Perhapave that in an inverted order buonder if you would—if you would comment on that.
Well of coursart of—of man's dilemma the individual dilemma is that man individual man is the victim of his past.
Actually there's—there's no such thing as "me" probably thaonglomeration oot of "us."
Probablreat deal of—of man's behavior is froattern that was fixed long before he entered it.
He inherited it that he can't help doing some of the thing he does.
He can't help his—his attitude toward that that he—he has.
He—he might be educated out of themhink that the—the wise person—I mean wise in the sense that Dilsey was wise to do the best she could with what she had she would know by instinct that she must—must abolish the past.
That she must accept—accept "now" and accept the—the moment in which "now" becomes "will be."
That she must be intact in "now" rather than to have one foot inside "now" and the rest of—of the body in "yesterday" if she is to cope with environmenton't know whether that makes any clearer what you asked or not.
Does ites sir.ave two questions about your short story "Lo!"
And the first one is what is the relation of the chief Francis Weddell to the Indians which we see in "A Courtship" or "Red Leaves" ...imply another—another clan.
They were the same Chickasaw people.
That was just another clan.
They may have been related by marriage even by blood but they had begun to take white names by that time.
When—as they became plantation owners and held U.S. commissions.
But he was—belonged to the same lot of people as Issetibbeha and his descendants.Welould you tell me when Weddell takes his Chickasaws to Washington takes his nephews and besieges the president whether this is just the action oaive savage or whether he all the time is planning on getting the best of the President think that requirereat deal of shrewdness that he was no longer iosition to take his spears and bows and arrows and his warriors and go there and get what he wanted so he used the white man's tacticshink that he was pretty shrewd about that that he just behaved iaive and innocent way but he wasn't.
That he had—had abolished the past and had taught himself pretty fast to cope with "now" with environment.
Yes sir.avouple of questions about The Sound and the Fury.
The first one is Quentin the daughter of Dalton Ames.
Do you remember thates.She ises.And the second one how do you think Quentin would have turned out if Jason wouldn't have been hounding her the all the time?
Would she have turned out well or ... don't know.
That whole family was against heroubt if any child as insecure as she was—to know suspect that she was—was insecure could have coped with that family of adults with nobody to defend her except the Negro woman.
Probably she was—was doomed in any environment she would have found herself in.I had the impression that she would have turned out fine if it hadn't have been for Jason.an't say.
I'm—I'm inclined to think that she was doomed that no matter what the environment would have been she was still doomed.
That's certainly poetically necessary in the book that she be.
That was the reason for—part of the reason for her uncle's Quentin's tragedyean the poetic reason not the actual reason.
Yes ma'am.In The Sound and the Fury you said that Maury Compson's name was changed to Benjamin.
You mention iumber of times ... various places in the book.
What was the purpose of changing his name and why—what was the importance of the change ...aury was his mother's brother the only brother and they werroud named family.
This child was given that proud name and when he began to appear to be an idiot they didn't want him named Maury so they changed his name.
Yes ma'am.Sir is there anything significance in the fact that at one point in The Sound and the Fury T.P.
says that Benjy was not only deaf—dumb but also deafo no Benjy wasn't really deaf but in T.P.
's concept if—if—if you're—you're "deaf and dumb" that means you can't talk and you—you just don't have any sense.
And he was saying "You're deaf 'cause you—you won't do whaell you to do."
He didn't mean that Benjy couldn't hear because he knew Benjy could.
But that was T.P.
's exasperation with this creature who was bigger than he was and yet was more trouble than an infant.
Does the name T.P.
stand for anything in particularo that was just his name.
Was Versh the same wayersh's name back in slavery times had probably been Virgil and then his people couldn't spell it and it passed from son to son and finally wound up as Versh.
It may have gone from Virgil to Verge and then it got to be VershYes sir.
This gentleman.Sir in Aay Dying which of Addie's children has the most love—love for her and why would say that Jewel did.
That Jewel himself didn't know why he did.
He was a—a child of love.
That he was illegitimate.
And he and his mother were closer.
He didn't know why.
She did.
Anmagine—and also by his—his nature that he was not the child of—of his shiftless father who loved nothing but his own comfort that Jewel had inherited something of warmth from his—his father.
Yes sir.Sir we're talking about names.
Just as we learn that Eck Snopes is really named Eckrum is there any longer name for I.O.
Mink and Flemo that's like T.P.
's name the I.O.
And Mink—Mink was an orphan.
He was raised by some kin people and he himself had never heard himself called anything but Mink.
Someone asked him in a—a—a book I'm at now what his name is.
He says "Mink."
He says "Is that all the name you've gote says "That's alnow."
And he's asked "What did your mother call youe said "I don't know.
She died."
That he—he doesn't know.
That's all he's heard cause he's raised—passed from hand to hand anybody that would feed a—a child liktray dog.
Yes sir.
would you saew words about the significance of the Easter service ... in The Sound and the Furynly that at that point it seemed to me that was needed just as the—the—the musician will put certain chords or themes or phrases into what he's doing.
He himself may not know why.
It seems obvious to him that something like that was needed and that's the best he could do.
It may be counterpoint to the—the dreary scene in the house with that selfish woman the mother and this child who's taken out of the house to—just so the—the woman—his own mother wouldn't be bad with him is taken to church with these people going—trying to—to follow the—the white man's concept of—of the passion story.
For emphasiuppose.
Yes sir.Was—was there resentment among the colored people about Benjy going to church with Dilseyo no none whatever.
Yes ma'am.Sir at one point in that Easter service Dilsey mentions that she has seen the beginning and the end.
What was it that referred to?
Was it religion or is it the familyt's the family.
She sees that there's doom on the family.
There—there may have been one hope—was—was that girl Quentin.
And Quentin is gone.
The doom which Dilsey had been fighting against all her life had happened.
And she saw the first of it and she did the best she could and now she's seen the end.
All that remains is an idiot boy that she takes to an Easter service iegro church that he can't even understand.
Yes sir.Sir in Aay Dying is there any significance—significance—significance in the fact that Vardaman catches the fish at the beginning and keeps comparing the death of it to that of his mother rather than it being some other animal perhapses.
That'uestion that'ittle—little hard for me to answer because anything in the book has some need more than significance.
There waeed it seemed to me that that should be there.
The connectioelt of the transference that the little boy made between the dead fish and the blood and his dead mother was—was an instance ohild's rationalizing thinking.
But there were no symbolism intended there.
Yes sir.
Speaking of symbolism on the dust jacket of first edition of The Sound and the Fury two figures seem to be wrestlinlack one is pinning dowhiter one.
Do you recall who the artist was and whether anything particular was intendedon'ton't know who did that.
Of course the—the—the symbolism was simply the powers of—of darkness and of light wrestling strugglingon't know whose idea that jacket was or who did it.
Yes sir.Sir the title of The Sound and the Fury is taken from Macbeth's speech isn't ites yes.
There must have—be at leasozen books named from that one speech.
Yes sir.It seems that one of the tragedies of Quentin Compson that was the greatest is the inability to view himself at all in time.
He has the obsession to begin with and then ... confused and then he battles time altogether mechanical and natural time he destroys his clock and he puts himself in the future and looks back at himself.
He's totally confused and yet totally obsessed with time trying to put it in some rational understanding for himself and he fails.
Anind of wonder if his—his failure after an attempted intellectual approach and Dilsey's success at more of an emotional approach which seemed to indicatollective attempt at trying to relate to time to live with time froatural perspective cannot be reached in an intellectual rational manner but more or less comes from an emotional or instinctive comprehension.
Remember Quentin was not trying to put time into perspective.
He was trying to escape from time into the past.
He was trying to escape back intime when all this whicate was not.
He failed and so he committed suicide.
There was only one more step left to him.
He couldn't be alive and escape back before when his sister was pure.
And so he had to commit suicide.
That was all that remained for him.
Dilsey accepted the past and she didn't waste herself trying to discard it or get away from it.
She simply accepted it and said "All right.
So it is.
Let's go on.
Let's go forward."
That time was—was in its perspectivhink for the both of them but—but one of them hated "now" and wanted to return to "was" which you can't do because what was is.
There's actually no such thing as "was."
As we said any man is the victim of—not only victim but the sum of his past.
He never escapes from it.
Quentin wanted to escape back into it.
Yes sir.
how real are the—the—these amorous exploits of Gerald Bland in The Sound and the Fury?
Is—is he just bragging trying to live up to his mother's dramatic conception of him or does he really ... suspect that most of them are lies.
That he would be like any fictioneer—nothing that happened would be quite as good as what he could imagine.
So the—the ones that actually happened would be dull to him.
The ones he told about were probably all lies.
Yes sir.Did Quentin before actually havonversation with his father about sleeping with his sister?
Or was that part of his ...e never did.
He said "Iere bravould—I might say this to my father whether it waie or not."
Or—or "Iere—iould say this to my father maybe he could answer me back the magic word which would relieve me of this anguish and agony whicive with."
No they were imaginary.
He just said "Supposay this to my father.
Would it help me?
"Today we are very fortunate to have as our special guesf Oxford Mississippi the celebrated—justly celebrated southern writer of fiction and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949.
Our panel is somewhat larger than usual today as several of the students from my English 32 class have joined us.
In addition to  Robert Kellogg of the Department of English one of our regular panel members we have with us also today  Houassey Miss Winslow Miss Taylor Miss Marston  Bagley  Nesbit  Miller  Carlson and Miss Frame of the class in the history of the English language who are here to asome questions about his use of dialect and other questions concerning language in his fiction writing.
Anuppose without further ado we might as well start on the questions.
Houk will you lead off with the first question please?
Houk Yesour character Doom has the—a curious history for his name.
His Indian name Ikkemotubbe was translated into L'homme or De l'homme in French then was translated by him back to Doom in Englishnderstand that's correct.
That's correct.
It was translated back to Doom not by him but by his associates trying to pronounce his French name given to him by the French adventurer who called himself the Chevalier Soeur-Blonde de Vitry that he met in New Orleans.
That was simply an anglicization of the French De l'homme.
Houk And that—that Anglicization would be your imagination—from your imagination rather than from facts.
In other words you do not knoarallel such as this one in Indian lore.
Nould certainly like to think I'd invented that.
I'd like to ask you about your use of "aint" in the dialogue of your characters.
In particular in Aay Dying.
When Anse Bundren is talking to Vernon Tull he says "I aint asking it of you he sayan always do it for me and mineint asking you to risk your mule.
It aint your deadm not blaming you."
Now why do you have the switch between—from "aint" to "am not"Am not" is more positive.So you use the "am not" when you are definite ...—  Yes to be very positive yes.
Otherwise they would have said "aint."
in The Portable  the editor says "Incidentally the title of the novel has nothing to do with August sunlight; it refers to Lena Grove and her baby.
In the Mississippi backwoods it is sometimes said oregnant woman but more often oare or cow that she will be light in August or September."
Is this how you meant it to be—the titleever heard of that.
It refers texture of the light in August in my country ipell of two or three cool days we call "blackberry winter."
It's the lightad never heard that business of after the cow drops the calf she's light in August.And that—you don't know that expression at all.
No.I haven't heard it in Georgia either.I suppose people have spoken to you of it since thenes.
in connection with this class in particular we've been very interested in reading about names in America about personal and geographical namesonder to what extent the names that you use parallel those that have actually occurred in your lifetime or in any history that you may have learned.hink any writer is very careful always not to use actual names if he can help it becausreat deal of his time would be taken up explaining to the actual owner of that name that he didn't refer to him was not impugning his character nor his past nor his parentage.Originally in "The Spotted Horses" story weren't you going to call the sewing machine salesman Suratt and then you met somebody by that name so you changed the name to Ratliff didn't youes that's right.
does the speech of Sartoris in the story "Ad Astra" have any special dialect qualities?
Is iouthern speech or is it just the speech of an average educated Americant would be the speech oimited young man who had no particular education.
It wapeech he had heard from his associates back on his Mississippi plantation colored jusittle by what he had listened to serving with English troops probably.
Ek Snopes uses the archaic word "lief" in "I'd just as lief let them stay out there."
Is this word still common in Mississippih yes there are any number of words derived from lowland Scottish in Mississippi country people's talk.
They say "to ret uoom.
"That "leif"—it may be just my own inexperience buaven't come across that in Georgiaonder—it may bifference between the speech of Georgia—popular speech folk speech in Georgia and in Mississippiemember being struck by that too becausasn't familiar with it in Georgia speech.
to what degree do you consider dialect in speech important in characterization think you can't draharacter simply by putting dialect into his mouth.
It is important aart of the picture of the man an indigenous picture of the individual.
In that sense it's important that ian will speak according to his nature his degree and his geography.Here's an examplhat might havearing on that.
In the story "Barn Burning" the little boy Sarty Snopes uses the forms the grammatical forms "ourn" and "hisn."
What do these tell the reader about the speaker would you sayhat he came from an uneducated class of white people.Those terms are in use in the southern mountains more than in the lowlandhink in the South more than in the coastal plains of the South.
Is there any implication that these people are from mountain extraction or anything of that sortes they're people whose dialect has not been colored at all by the talk of—of Negroes.
They are mountain people where there are not many Negroes.
Their speech is harsher.
The "r" is more definite than the "r" in the white child that has lived with Negroes.Yes.
Of course that's an old controversy whether the Negroes learned their speech from the white people or whether the white people were influenced by the Negroesuess we'd better not get into that—it's too complicateuestion.
again from Sartoris Old Man Falls itrong dialect characterization.
How did you arrive at his speech and what level of society is he intended to represente represents the—the older class of Southerner.
He was not quite illiterate in his time as the—anopes would be in his.
He halose association with people that—that were literate.
But he too belongs to the—the class whose ancestors owned no slaves.as wondering from your short story "That Evening Sun"—there'ection when Jason talks with Nancy he says I'm quoting now "'I didn't have fun' Jason said.
'You hurt me.
You put smoke in my eyes.
Y'awl made me come.'"
Anonder are you using "y'awl" there as a—directed at Nancy?
In other words is he—is that singularo no never.You've never used "y'awl" in the singularever singular.Have you ever heard it used in the singularo.I never have either.
I'll bear you out on that.
Not boutherner.
I've heard northerners use it in the singular.
there'raditional character in literature Sophonisba who was the daughter of Hasdrubal and the subject of many tragedies.
She is not known too much todaon't think but your character from the short story "Was" from Go Down Moseelieve Miss Sophonsibelieve is the way you pronounce her name is that—is the change of that "s" from Sophonisba to Sophonsibhange just of the "s" not of the accent is that your—is that intentionalntentional in this sense to imply that the people of—of her—her class and her time were—were involved with—with books with culture but they were careless with it too and they would mispronounce the names they would take classical names and give to the Negro slaves and would probably mispronounce them so that after the—the Negro had passed it on to his children it became something else but at one time it came out of the classics that someone who had read the Latin or the Greek had seen it.We've sort of talked around thisas wondering do you have any key by which you go to makistinction between the dialogue of your various—the various levels of your characters such as between the Compsons the Snopes the Negroes and the Indians and so forth?
Is there anything that you use aistinction between these two between all of theseo of course not deliberately.
It's a—a—a concept that the Compson would speaittle differently fronopes or from an intermediate between Compson and Snopes.
That'atter of the ear that these people—wheriter gets the character properly on his feet the character takes charge of things.
The character says "This is what I'm going to say you put it down.
"Thank you very muchur time will not permit further questioning at this session but be with us again next week when again our Writer in Residencf Oxford Mississippi will be with the members of the English 32 class in order to answer questions concerning his use of dialect and of language in general in his fiction.
With us on the panel today have been  Robert Kellogg of the Department of English and various and sundry members of the English 32 class whose nameaven't time to mention at this time.
This iswith the Department of English asking you to be again with us at the same time next week for another session on this same subject.
Announcer Our host for the pr— gap in tape Stevenson of the Department English Language and Literature of the University in Charlottesville.
theme music Now here's  Stevenson.We're very happy to bring you again today our Writer in Residence at the Universitf Oxford Mississippi who has consented to speak to the members of the English 32 class in the history of the English language concerning matters involving his use of dialect or any feature of his use of language in his fiction.
Our panel is therefore somewhat larger than usual.
Besides myself and  Kellogg of the Department of English we have  Houassey Miss Winslow Miss Taylor Miss Marston  Bagley  Nesbit  Miller  Carlson and Miss Frame of the English 32 class.And now without further ado Miss Winslow will you please lead off with the first question?
Winslo've noticeot of your short stories have very short titles.
Do you think that's more effective thaong title doubt if there can be any rule about thathink that anything the shorter it's said the betterhink that—that stories title themselves quite often.
Yes in that anything the shorter it's said the better it is.
"Long" i.. good long title or "Wash."  this might sound likypical question froroud Virginian but how did you arrive at—at—arrive at the name Jefferson for the town told that iook called Requiem foun.
It was the mail carrier in 1811 or '12 it was who brought the mail into what was then an Indian trading post had—had beeenant on  Jefferson's place one of  Jefferson's places here in Albemarle County.
It's an involved long story but it explains how they named the town Jefferson.Well that's interestingever knew that it really was connected with Thomas Jefferson.
Very good.
in your writing of dialogues do you present the words of your characters as they would have spoken them?
Or do you just usouch of dialect to color the character think best to use as little dialect as possible because it confuses people who are not familiar with it.
That nobody should let the character speak completely in his own vernacular.
It's best indicated bew simple sparse but recognizable touches.
Robert Kellog'd like to ask youestion if it's not too involved along those lines.
Last week we were talking about the use of dialect to differentiate the classes that people originated in the social classes the geographical locationas wondering perhaps about the use of language ohild narrator.
I've noticed in say for example "That Evening Sun" lots of Quentin's sentences seem short and perhaps the wahild might speak them and yet it's pretty grown-up foine-year-old to report all of the things he doesonder whether you'd comment on his rather accurate reporting.
One has to take liberties to that extenthink that some of the things that Huck Finn recorded he couldn't have done at his age.
That's the liberties which the writer must take in order to make his story clear and interesting.
Robert Kellogg And yet we—we assume his point of view throughout the story is that not soes that his point of view is still that of his age even though his diction may not be.
Robert Kellogg Yes sir.Sir would you make any distinction between what saouthern mountain character would say in 1920 and what he would say in 1950 or is it just all what you heard when you were in ... think that his—his vernacular his dialect wouldn't alter so much as his vocabulary might increasittle because of radio and—and books and newspapers which he can get or he can't escape from getting in 1950 which he couldn't get in 1910 or '20.Let me put iort oariation on that question.
Do you try to make any distinction between what you conceive today to be the speech say of the 1880s and maybe the 1920so more than we just stated the vocabulary might change but the—the diction wouldn't.
in listening to several of your talkind it sort of curious and rather remarkable that often you use what is generally considered to be bad grammar for instance "he dont" "aint."
Do you havonscious intent in talking in this mannero.Is it a—certainlave no question that you know what good grammar is .... Is it jusecollection in your mind of the speech in Mississippi at the ...robably old muscular habits in speech if you will agree that—that speech can have old muscular habits just like the arm or the hand can.
To me that's not really too important thaittle bad grammar don't hurt anything.That's really more old fashionehink than anything else.
Probably yes.You find—you find for instance things like "he don't" in the letters of Lord Byron I've noticed.Sir do you think that the dialect or speech of the southern Negro ieterrent to his progress ...houldn't think that—that anyone's speech should beterrent to his progress if he just don't use too much of ithinot of— Well put.hinot of people talk too much.
the wife in "The Fire and the Hearth" ... an educated Negro woman seems in direct contrast to Old Man Falls in Sartoris.
This iranscription of her speech "Where are you going this time of night?
Messing around up yonder in the bottom all last night!
Getting back home just in time to hitch up and get to the fielood hour after sunup."
Whereas Old Man Falls is "Cunnel was settin' thar iheer his sock feet propped on the po'ch railin' smokin' this hyer very pipe."
Since the copyright date on Sartoris is 1929 and the copyright date on Go Down Moses from which "The Fire and the Hearth" is taken is much later does this difference in true—in the representation of dialect indicatefinite trend on your part or is this merelocial difference would say it'ocial difference that the Negro woman maybe haittle more to say to tell the story which gets back to what we just spoke of.
Also she had been associated witetter class of white—a more literate cultured class of white people for more of her life than Old Man Falls had.
It may be the Negro woman haittle more chance to talk than Old Man Falls had.
there has appeared in American Speech magazine some articles on the southern dialect and it points out certain peculiarities about the Southern dialect.
Now these articles were written by men who—in the Mississippi and Louisiana area.
The inconsistency seems to appear in the fact that some of these examples that they show are not consistent with examples shown in the Georgia dialect or perhaps in—in the Carolinas.
My question is this do you think that there could possibly bplit in the southern dialect between the Carolinas and Georgia and perhaps draough line down Alabama and havifferent dialect on your side?
Sort of two subdialects maybe an eastern anestern division of the Southern dialect?
That's right.
I'm not too certain of thato know the dialect in some parts of Mississippi and Louisiana has been coloreittle by French and Spanish influencehink that the dialect would be consistent more by contour lines.
As  Stevenson spoke of the people of the lowlands speak differently from the people in the hills so the people in the north Alabama hills and east Tennessee hills and Georgia hills would speaialect.
The people in the flatlands of Georgia the flatlands of Alabama and Mississippi would speaialect which would be almost identical.
The people along the coast would speaialect colored jusittle by the influence of Spanish and French and Creole.In connection with this sir Wash Jones uses speech characterized by the following "air" for "are" "yit" for "yet" and "hit" for "it" and various others of course.
Although we know from our studies in our class that this is generally common Southern speech many of your characters on somewhat the same social plane as Wash Jones do not use this type of speech.
In the genealogy at the rear of the—Absalom Modern Library Absalom Absalom!
Wash Jones is said to—it's said that the date and location of his birth is unknown.
Could we assume possibly that he comes from—from somewhere in Tennessee if he uses this speechroill country yes.Here'uestion I'd like to get in before our time runs out abouinguistic device that writers often use more commonly seen in poets perhaps than in prose fiction in poetry rather than in prose fiction refer to the use of alliteration.
And let me read yoentence from "Barn Burning" and note the alliteration on the "s" sounds.
"His two hulking sisters"—this is the little boy's point of view—"His two hulking sisters in their Sunday dresses and his mother and her sister in calico and sunbonnets were already in it sitting on and among the sorry residue of the dozen and more movings which even the boy could remember."
Was thaonscious use of alliteration or is it just happenstanceappenstance.Sure enough.
Do you ever use alliteration consciouslyon't have time.
audience laughteean by that the writer is too busy getting the story down before he forgets it to bother too much about his grammar or his style or the tricks he might use.But in the process of revision mightn't you scratch out sometimes and substitute something which you think would sounittle better reviser would but nobody is going to revise if he can help it.
That is nobody revises for fun.
If it's all right he lets it go.
The publisher can correct the grammar if he thinks it's needed.Welee our time has run outant to thanery much—  ..ive with.
No they were imaginary.
He just said "Supposay this to my father would it help me?
Would it clarify?
Woulee clearer what it is thanguish overThe feeling between him and his sister is pretty strong though isn't ites yes.
But in Caddy's opinion he was—was such a—a weakling that even if they had been no kin she would never had chosen him for her sweetheart.
She would have chosen one like the—the ex-soldier she did but never anybody like Quentin.
Is Candacommon name in Mississippi or—o.
No Caddy seemeice name for her anad to think of something to justify it.
audience laughteYes sir.You said that your vision of Caddy was one of the things that started you on the novel.
What qualities other than bravery seem to you to make her sucerson that you could feel that strongly abouthe was independent herself.
She was confident.
She was compassionate enough to take care of the idiot child.
That was no burden to her.
If—her mother never had to say "Caddant you to look after Benjamin this afternoon."
Because she loved him.
She would have done that anyway.
And she was convinced that she could do the best for him.
If what she couldn't do Dilsey would tend to with that Benjamin would be all right with her.
She could look after him.
And that she could take care of all of them.
If there was something that would be pleasant for them to do she would run the affair.
Yes sir.
I'm curious about Jason ... that Negro boy tells him to keep his hands out of his pockets because he's falling on his face all the time.
He stumbles.
Why was he fat and clumsy when he was youngerrobably that waannerism keeping his hands in his pocket.
To me that—that presaged his future something of greediness and grasping selfishness.
That he may have kept his hands in his pocket to guard whatever colored rock that he had found that was for him—represented the million dollars he would like to have someday.
Yes sir.In the thumbnail sketch you describe—describe Luster as beinan of fourteen capable of taking care of an idiot and entertaining him at the same time.
Why—why do you consider Lusteanecause he could dan's job.
At this time the idiot was twice his size was actually dangerous.
The idiot by that time was—waan and yet Luster at fourteen could cajole him when necessary could trick him could even apply enough physical force when necessary to keep him in hand.
It's like the lion tamer is—ian.
It means simply that he's big enough for his job.
That's what Luster—I meant by that.
In Luster's terminologan is anyone who is big enough to do what he has to do.
Yes sir.Sir in part two of The Sound and the Fury the little Italian girl following Quentin is this to represent ...'m sorryon't remember her.
I'll have to get that book and look at it.
I—I can't remember her.
Maybe  Gwynn could prompt mittle therehe was the sister of Julio.
Quentin really ... sees in her some innocence and calls her little sister quitit.
Is that in Cambridge?
Yes sir or outside of Cambridge—  Welean when he is at Harvard.
Well that's probably what it was.
No symbolism.
It was—he had a—a—a—a tenderness a—an admiration for—for women for girls and also a—a sublimation of the concept of virginity after his tragic situation with his sister.
It may be that's what it was.
Yes sir.Does Quentin commit suicide by jumping in the river or—es by drowning.
Yes.
Yes ma'am.
you say that the—some things you don't know exactly why you put them in.
Would you say that the so-called psychological critics could now tell you why you put them into your books good psychologist certainly could or he would bad psychologist if he couldn't.
audience laughtehink that—that one readook from the same jumping off place that one writeook that one readook from his own background of—of observation imagination and experience too.
That no one man can put intook whaozen men can—can read into it.But don't you think artistic control keeps the psychologist from analyzing the writing ...  No'on't think so.
Maybon't understand what you mean by artistic control.Well don't you have to put the things iertain order objectify them and make them just the opposite from whasychologist wants them ... wouldn't think so.
The writer is—is writing from his own observation imagination experience and out of the same background which the psychologist operates from.
That is from the—call it Christianity the—the Caucasian race.
The same background of education of environment which is the same time—period in time and they would have some of the identical ideas which came from that near to identical backgrounds which are identical in the period of time in the—the culture of the country of the speech of the literature.
Yes sir.Sir in Aay Dying what was the significance of Darl's lying in front of his mother's coffin after it was saved from the firearl was mad.
He did things which it seemed to me he—he had to do or he insisted on doing.
His reasonould—could try to rationalize to—to suit myself or even iouldn't rationalize his reasons to please mad to accept the acts because Darl insisted on doing thatean that—that any character that you write takes charge of his own behavior.
You can't make him do things once he comes alive and stands up and casts his own shadow.
Darl did things which I'm—I'm sure were for his own mad reasons quite logicalouldn't always understand why he did things but he did insist on doing things and when we would—would quarrel about it he always won  because at that time he was alive.
He was under his own power.
Yes sir.
you mentioned that your characters are struggling to cope with the dilemma of life.
Are any of them actually successful in reachinoint where life is not—does not present itself ailemmaell they reacoint where life is no longer a—a—an uncopeable dilemma.
There is onewing machine agent called Ratliff that—that handled living pretty well.
There are others that handled it pretty wellhink Dilsey did though hers was tragic.
But it never did—it might have dented her heaittle but it never beat her to her knees.
Ratliff got along quite well with it because he realized—recognized his own limitations and the fact that the dilemma although it was insoluble was not uncopeable withhink Flem Snopes—he coped with it pretty well.
Yes ma'am.Where did you find all your information on the Chickasaw Indians?
Are there records ...es'm.
There—there are records there buever did do much researchould—I probably got my information about Indians as I've got it about most of the other thingnow from listening to people and addinittle imagination to ituspect that—that no Chickasaw would recognize my Chickasaws  but people that do know more about Mississippi's history don't quarrel too much with my picture of Chickasaw Indians.
And alsave known some of their descendants.
They have mixed with white people or with Negroes—are still in my country.
Anon't think that—that people are all that different no matter what color they are.
That people are different more because of the pressure of their environment than because of their blood.
Yes sir.... accept and endure throughout your work ... meaning of thathat probably refers to man getting along within the human predicament.
That you've got to accept it because the only other choice is to cut your throat.
If you cope with it within your capacity to give when it's stronger than you then you endure.
And the only alternative to enduring is also to—to cease.
And man is—is here through no choice of his own.
He has—as far as he knows he's not going anywhere else and if he does anything with what time he knows who he is it will have to be while he is here and he had bettehink teach himself to accept the predicament and to endure in it and still get as much pleasure as he can without doing harm to anyone.
Or if he's bent on doing good to people that's well enough.
Let him uplift man.
But in order to accomplish anything to briter to be a—a doctor to do anything well to—even to have fun you've got to accept the predicament and endure in it.
Yes sir.I wonder how did you happen to have come up with the title The Sound and the Fury from Macbeth anhought that perhaps it came from the speech—I mean the speech that it came from—"all our yesterdays"—of Macbeth himself anondered if there was any merit in the analogy of the character Macbeth who having created his own chaos inflicts it on life and the universe with the same actions of Quentin Compson ...o it came simply from the—the words themselves the—the ringing sound of the phrase—"A tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury."
It had nothing to do with—with Macbeth's character.
It was simply from the phrase.
Yes sir.The part of Benjy is the tale told by an idioould assume.
Yes.
Yes the book began ahort story.
Benjamin of course waeliberate choice from the biblical Benjamin.
Sorry.I was wondering in your Indian stories again "Lo!"
and "A Courtship" and in "A Justice" except for the framework your stories—these stories are very humorous but in "Red Leaves" while there iood deal of wry humor that story seems to be much more serious anondered if you'd care to comment.
Only in primitive peoples—I mean by primitive peoples a—a small group which are obsolete inside another culture—the—the distance between what is humor and what is tragic is never very great that it—it may be funny now but you better watch out.
That was simply that—that the same conditions the same ingredients with jusittle more or little less fire under it might make something completely different.
That the—the implacable pursuit of that poor Negro was funny to anybody but him and that not—and also it was not funny to the Indians that had to stop sitting down to get up and walk him down to catch him.
But the picture of—of those lazy people that didn't want to do that having to—to catch that Negro to me was funny.
But the result the purpose of it was anything but funny.
The Indians that went to call on President Jackson was funny but it wasn't funny to the Indians and certainly wasn't very funny to President Jackson.
Yes ma'am.I was wondering... what you call inheritance but in the moment that you state ... think whantend to say is man's immediate behavior is the result of the pressure of his environment.
The—the method in which he behaves of course is—is heredity.You think it is more or less ...'m sorry.If it does not change very much ... think that heredity if the word means anything must bonstant factor.
That would not change.
It would alter.
It would evolve.
Man's behavior which at one moment is this and in—under another situation is that is because of the pressure of the immediate environment.
But irregardless of his—his blood his heritage circumstance will compel him to—to make choices.
He will make the choice according to the pressure of the environment....
The future is already know   Ma'am.The future to you—you feel is done.
... for that moment you can more or less predict ... from that moment their behavior ...aybe we mean different things by—by environment.
Whese that terean the immediate conditions of—of—ooment.
The environment that has—has shapehild's character from the time it was born until it's ten years old has becomart of heritage by that timese environment as the immediate moment.
That is environment to me now is—is us in this room.
Yes sir.Does this mean that young Bayard Sartoris for example inherited death by violenceeath by violence was—waart of his past.
It was a—a—a part of the creed of his family.
He inherited that creed.
He didn't have to—to function according to it.
Which he didn't he refused to do that.
Because he was—was saying—trying to repudiate the past not to cling to it.
His tradition was that—that death by violence came sooner or later if you stuck to the creed of an eye-for-an-eye blood-for-blood and the—the emptiness of that sort of pride.
That was his inheritance.
But his behavior was because of his environment which had—which was the result oost war in which people should have had enough of blood-for-blood and an eye-for-an-eye.
That that solved nothing.
Yes sir.Sir do you recalhort story you wrote called "Delta Autumn"es sir.I wonder what would be the comment of Flem Snopes if suctory were told to him as being truehuppose he would—he wouldn't be too interested in it because there would be no percentage in going to the woods for two weeks just to shoot deer.
He would be familiar with it.
It would be a—a—a foolish way to spend two weeks.
Was that what you meant?
... different stories.
Is—this is the story where the ... going off to Arizona with this Negro woman.
Isn't that part of the story of "Delta Autumn"Delta Autumn" was a—a camp of deer hunters in which a—a young womaegress the discarded mistress of—of one of the white hunters came to the camp to see him.That was the part of the story thaas referring to that what Flem Snopes' comment would be on that sort of thing happening within his environment.
Well that was his environment.
He lived there too.
He just didn't go deer hunting.
He probably had—had children begro woman himself.
Yes sir.
John Church Sir you've mentioned that these people in The Sound and the Fury are doomed.
Is it your theory also that people everywhere are doomed or is it just these people in Mississippio no  only the—  laughing no only—only the Compson family— John Church Sirnly that Compson family.
John Church Oh the Compsons.
That they had refused to accept now and tomorrow.
And there's no place for them in now because they wouldn't accept it.
Or maybe that's backward if there had beelace for them they wouldn't have been Compsons.
No that's what Dilsey meant by the first and the last.
It was the Compsons that family.
That was Quentin's thought.
It's not Mississippians nor folks in Jefferson but—but "us Compsons are doomed that we have had it.we're forced to accept now and tomorrow and thank you very much.
Oh thank you all.
I think I'll take the moderator's privilege and ask the first question iay.
I'd like to knoittle bit about the circumstances of the composition of "The Bear."
Can you remember when it was that you first thought of it and put it down ... couldn't—couldn't say.
That story is probablummation of—of my whole experience from the first timas big enough to go into the woods where bears were witun untiecaman.
Probably—that story may be autobiographical in the sense that it was that little boy's confrontation with something big and important for he himself to find how he would meet it to—as Hemingway says "to meet it with grace."
Whaean is probablas composing that story from the first momenent into the—what we call the big woods and—and realized what it was.
There would be bigger animals wilder animals than the rabbits and possums and things thaad experience with wheas not big enough yet to carrun into the woods.You really began composing it when you were Isaac's age think so yes or remembered it and then whead acquired some skill in the craft of writing to write my own biography against something which was a—a fine pleasure to morthwhile pursuit which is probablart of any boy's life any American boy unless he has—was bred and lived all his life in the citymagine there are not many of you here who haven't hunted.
When you first havun rabbits possums and then you got big enough to hunt bigger game than that.Have you written anything else about Boon Hogganbeck after "The Bear"e is one of my stable of people thaonsider myself the owner and proprietor of.
audience laughtehinave used him occasionally at needon't recall now specifically what stories or books but I—I believave used him.
But he hasn't been the central character in a—a story like he was there or one of the central characters.
Yes sir.
since you put such meaning into the hunt could you tell us just why you hunted when you weroung boy or—or what meaning the hunt has to youhe hunt was simply a—a symbol of pursuit.
Most of—of anyone's life iursuit of something.
That is the only alternative to life is immobility which is death.
This was a—a symbolization of the pursuit which iormal part of—of anyone's life while he stays alive told in terms which were familiar to me and—and dramatic to me.
The protagonist could have been anything else beside that bearimply toltory which was a—a natural normal part of anyone's life iamiliar and to me interesting terms without any deliberate intent to put symbolism in itas simply telling something which was in this case the child the—the need the compulsion of the child to adjust to the adult world.
It's how he does it how he survives it whether he is destroyed by trying to adjust to the adult world or whether despite his small size he does adjust within his capacity.
And always to learn something to learn something of—not only to pursue but to—to overtake and then to have the compassion not to destroy.
To—to catch to touch and then let go because then tomorrow you can pursue again.
If you destroy what you caught then it's gone.
It's finished.
And that to me is—is sometimes the greater part of valor but always it's the greater part of pleasure not to destroy what you have pursued.
The pursuit is the—is the thing not the reward not the—the gain.
Yes ma'am.Sir you explained to us that Ike—the story of Ike in "The Bear" is ianner of speaking autobiographical.
Does Ike's theory ourse on the land in any way reflect your feeling ourse on the lando—well if—if it—if it should it would not be maybe as strong as Ike'shink that any author should—should put on the—a full page in his book that he is not responsible for the ideas expressed by any of his characters their ideas or political convictions or—or religious beliefs.
I—I think that Ike probably carried thaittle further than—thaight have because it was necessary for my story that he should.
That he was a—he waoet in his way an idealist whicrobably am not or anyway not as goone as Ike.
Yes sir.entral theme of Absalom Absalom!
is that Sutpen will not or cannot acknowledge Charles Bon as his son.
Why does he not do this why—why—why does he leave it to Henry?
It—it seemed to me it would have been more in keeping with Sutpen's character to ... confession of it to Bon or if he had even destroyed Bon so that hWell he didn't acknowledge Bon for the reason that—that Bon was part Negro.
To have acknowledged Bon as his son would have destroyed the very dream the drive which had compelled him to go through hardship and—and suffering to begin with.
He couldn't acknowledge Bon as his son.Did he acknowledge Clytemnestra as his daughtero.
Well that would not have mattered because Clytemnestra waemale.
The important thing to him was he should establisine of dukes you see.
He was going to creatukedom.
He'd have to havale descendent.
He would have to establisukedom which would be his revenge on the white Virginian who told him to go to the back door.
And so he—he—to havegro—half-Negro for his son would have wrecked the whole dream so he couldn't.
If he had thought that—that it would ever be exposed that Bon was his son he may have killed Bon himself.
If it'd ever come to that point he would destroy Bon just as he would destroy any other individual that got in his way.Sir you said that you as the author are not responsible for what your character is saying.
How about the language that they use?oticed that some of the dialogue in "The Bear" waittle bit above the level of the average southerner speaking as someone who has ... .
Did you mean that to be realistic or is that just poetic license think that'icense that the writer should be permitted.
He is—is trying to—to take an instant in man's struggle within the—the human dilemma and isolate it in some dramatic form and he hasn't got the time to do it that—that living people would—would have.
They would have days and weeks to tell this story but he has got to tell it in thirty minutes or two or three hours or at most two days.
He has got to emphasize over-emphasize at times.
He's got to under-emphasize at others.
So that is his—the privilege of his craft to—to puort of poetry into the mouths of people that in real life would be incapable of speaking poetry.
He sticks just enough to the natural and to dialect to make what they say believable even though you say "Well he couldn't have expressed this idea in this way."
You say "Well anyway he would have expressed it in this language."
That's one of the—the privileges that you must give the writer that he is sticking to the fundamental truth but he can distort fact jusittle if—in order to—to get his story told ioving dramatic way.
Yes sir.Sir how did you happen to choose Old Ben ...e was the—the biggest untamed creature in the woods at that time.
The—the other—the Indian was gone the—the—the buffalo the—the other big wild creatures had been eliminated by that time.
Only the bear remained.
He was the biggest wild thing to brotagonist in the—the story of this little boy's adjustment to the adult world.Then—shink that maybe Old Ben waon-fictional character theno there's no writer ever will be satisfied to take any character from real life put him in the book because he's convinced he can duch better at that than God can.
He's going to improve and warp and distort no matter how much he concentrates on trying to tell—stick to factsriter simply couldn't stick to facts.
The truth really is not in him.
That's why they call it fiction.
Yes ma'am.I'd like to go back to Charles Bon in Absalom Absalomave the impression that up until very near the end of the book that he did not realize that he was Sutpen's son.
Because he's several times mentioned wondering what the secret was that his mother kept and worried about.
And yet about twenty or thirty pages from the end of the book he says to Henry that "It's the miscegenation and not the incest that you fear in my marriage to Judith."
So at what point did—did he find this out and how did he find out think that Bon knew all the time that—that his mother was part Negress but during Bon's childhood that was not important.
He grew up in—in the Indies and New Orleans where that wasn't too important.
His mother waealthy woman.
She could have called herselreole whether she had Negro blood along with the French or not.
It became important only when Bon realized that it was important to his fatherhink that Bon got into that business—well of course because he formeriendship with Henry and felt that he—that Henry the—the ignorant country boy had given hiort of worship an admiration anorship which—which he enjoyed.
Then when he saw the sort of stiff-necked man that Henry's father was and knew that that was his father too he iay had given his fathehance to say "I will acknowledge you but if you—io openly and you stay here you will wreck whaave devoted my life to and so take my love and gohink Bon would have done but this old man was afraid to do that.
And Bon tempted him to hold him over the coals in partly—in revenge on his treatment of his—Bon's mother until Bon got involved too deeply.
No Bon knew that he waegro but until he found it was important to Sutpen that wasn't important to him that he was a—a gentleman had been well bred cultured much better bred and cultured than Henry himself was.
Yes sir.Did Bon love Judith or was he just using her ... think he loved herhink that he loved her.
He knew that—that if she knew that he was part Negro with her training and background it would have destroyed her too.
Yes sir.Returning to "The Bearhy did you put Part Five after Part Fourhat story was part oovel.
It was—the—the pursuit of the bear was simply what you might call a—a—a dangling clause in the description of that man when he waoung boy.
When it was taken from the book and printed ahort story the publisher who is very considerate hareat respect for—for all work and for mine in particular he would not have altered one word of that without asking me.
And he didn't ask me.
If he had—had told me he was going to print it separatelould have said "Take this out.
This doesn't belong in this ahort story.
It's part of the novel but noart of the story."
But rather than to go ahead and do that without asking me—I—I wasn't available at that time—he printed it as it was.
It—it doesn't belong in there ahort story.
The way to read that is to skip that when you come to it.
audience laughteYes sir.In Absalom Absalom!
is any one of the people who talks about Sutpen have the right view or is it more or lesase of thirteen ways of looking alackbird with none of them getting it righthat's it exactlyhink that—that no one individual can—can look at truth.
It—it—it blinds you.
You look at it and—and you—you see one phase of it.
Someone else looks at it and seelightly awry phase of it but taken all together the truth is—is in what they saw though nobody saw the truth intact.
So—so these are—are true as far as—as Miss Rosa and as Quentin saw it.
Quentin's father saw what—what he believed was truth.
That was all he saw.
But the old man was—was himselittle too big for—for people no greater in stature than Quentin and Miss Rosa and  Compson to see all at once.
It would've taken probabliser or more tolerant or more sensitive or more thoughtful person to see him as he was.
It was as you say thirteen ways looking alackbird.
But the trutould like to think comes out that when the reader has read all these thirteen different ways of looking at the blackbird the reader has his own fourteenth image of that blackbird whicould like to think is the true oneYes sir.
Coldfield in Absalom Absalom!
retreats into the attic when the war between the states starts.
Now why did he do that?
Was it because he was sort oonscientious objector or was he all or part cowardo he—he was probably by religious scrupleonscientious objector.
Also he was very likelnionist that he hated that threat to the dissolution of the Union.
That he hadn't enough courage to do anything about it except to hide his head in the sand.
But I—I think that he was probablnionist.
He probably came from—from eastern Tennessee where the people were Unionists at that time.
His background was a—a tradition of—of fidelity to the United States as it was.
He had no agrarian tradition behind him in which slavery was—was an important part of itYes sir.Was  Coldfield an honest man or was he ...e was probably honest in a—a timorous sort of way.
He waan probably withoureat deal of courage.
He was honest simply because that wasn't very risky.
That he was cold anmagine selfish but—but in his dealings behind the counter of his store he was probably honest because that was less trouble and less risk.
He was not rapacious.
He had no driving desire to amasot of money.
Yes sir.
why does Major de Spain stop the railroad when the bear is—the small bear is stuck in the treehe bear would have stayed up the tree and starved until the train stopped running and it got quiet.
Then he would come down again.
But he would stay up the tree and then when he decided things were quiet and would start down another train would pass.
He would go back up the tree and stay there until he starved.
That was the reason.Sir—  Yes sir.Are there any real life Sam Fathers leftell in the sense that too much time has passed there could be nobody half Negro slave and half an Indian chief.
He might be one-eighth an Indian chief by now but he couldn't have been the son of an Indian chief anegro slave anymore.
And so he would be changed warped softeneittle by a—a different—a tamer environment than Sam Fathers grew up in.
Yes sir.In the creation of "The Bear" were you in any way influenced by Melville writeave said several times this year and last year too is influenced by everything he ever reads.
He—he himself doesn't bother.
He knows—he doesn't think it important enough to say "I was influenced at this moment by so and so."
He is omnivorous voracious and completely amoral.
He is influenced by everything he ever reads.
He will rob and steal right and left with complete impunity because he's not only perfectly willing but he's flattered when people after him rob and steal from him that if it's good enough for another writer to steal from him it must have been pretty good.
So if anything he's flattered.
I'm suras influenced by Melville influenced by Flaubert by the Old Testament by everything thaver read in the days wheead voraciously with no judgment.
Yes sir.How did you happen to start using this particular means of communication your style?
How did you hit on this ...hat just happened so.
I—my opinion is that the book creates its own style.
The writer is too busy to bother with style.
He's too busy to bother with grammar even or standard punctuation.
Get it down and somebody in the publishing office will correct it for you.
The main thing is—is to get it down and the exigencies of the story the people in it compel and create the style.
That if you begin to write style then that implies that you ain't got very much to put in it and so you begin to write prose and rhetoric which is all right and pleasant enough but it's hardly worth anybody's trouble to read.
Yes sir.
in Sartoris did you make Simon the Negro house maricky or comic character or did something corrupt him to make him ...hat was just what the white folks saw in him because his training his—his environment had taught him that that's what the white folks look to see in Negroes and Negroes got along better if they act like black-faced comedians when white people were looking at them.
That's one of the Negro's tragedies.
No that was just Simon's Sunday suit you might say.
Yes sir.
in "The Bear" who is your favorite characterelever—never thought about that.
obably haven't oneike all of them.
I—I—I admire the fyce dog very much.
Buad—I never thought which one was my favorite characterYes sir.Getting back to your style do you find that at first in your writing that you manipulateood many things and then it became easier and easier and—and probably no longer seems to worry about such things as revising and send it directly to the publishing houseo it never has got any easier.
If anything it's harder.But do you manipulate and change words ...ometimes until it comes right.
Sometimeon't have toever have to changord.
Sometimeork the thing six and seven and eight and nine years.
Buever know.
That's part of the charm of writing to me is the—the absolute uncertainty of it.Yes but at any rate it's not juspontaneous thing now ...ell sometimes it is yes.... not always.
Not alwaysYes sir.You said that in Absalom Absalom!
there were thirteen ways of looking at it.
What is your way?
How do you feel about Thomas Sutpenhat the truth about Thomas Sutpen came out of all the thirteen different people that looked at him.I meanean like you said about Caddy you said that Caddy was the darling of your heart.
Is he the darling of your heartelaid only thaorked hardest and anguished and suffered more over that book over The Sound and the Fury.
It—I—I feel toward that as—as the parent does toward the—the afflicted child maybe.
Thaorked the longest and the hardest over it and it still is not as good as it should be.
So did I—so is Absalom Absalom!
not as good as it should be but theidn't have to anguish over that as muchould bring myself to the point of saying "I've done the besan with it and write something else now.
Let it alone."
It tooong time with The Sound and the Fury for that.
Sir speaking of those two books as you read Absalom Absalom!
how much caeader feel that this is the Quentin the same Quentin who appears in The Sound and the Fury that ian thinking about his own Compson family his own sistero me he's consistent that he approached the Sutpen family with—with the same ophthalmia that he approached his own troubles that he probably never saw anything very clearly that his was just one of the thirteen ways to look at Sutpen and his may have been the—one of the most erroneous.
Probably his friend McCannon hauch clearer picture of Sutpen from what Quentin told him than Quentin himself would.
It's still Sutpen's story not Quentin's story.
No it's—it's Sutpen's story.
But then every time any character gets into a—a—a book no matter how minor he is actually telling his biography.
That's all anyone ever does he tells his own biography talking about himself.
Ihousand different terms but himself.
Quentin was still trying to—to get God to tell him why.
In Absalom Absalom!
maybe he was in The Sound and the Fury.
Yes ma'am.Sir I'd like some help on understanding the—whaall the bedroom scene in the fourth section of "The Bear."
You made one statement "She is lost.
She was born lost."
Can you help me to understand what you meant by thatho does that refer to?
That refers to Ike McCaslin's wife.
In—in that section ...—  Yes I—I thinemember now.
She—from her background her tradition sex was—was something evil that it had to be justified by acquiring property.
She was ethicallrostitute.
Sexually she was frigidhink what he meant—he knew that—that there was no warmth that he would ever find from her no understanding no—no chance ever to—to accept love or return love because she was incapable of it.
That's probably what he meant.Anondered why she laughed ..... he would ever find from her no understanding no—no chance ever to—to accept love or return love because she was incapable of it.
That's probably what he meant.Anondered why she laughed and laughed when ...he realized then that he was going to give up the land.
She married him because she was going to be chatelaine olantation.
And then she found he was going to give all that away and the only revenge she knew was to not—to deny him sexually that was the only triumph she had.
And she was going to make him suffer for that just as much as she could to get even with him.So that she intended from the beginning of her marriage to deny him this one thing that he had requested until it was useful in blackmailing ...ell she assumed when they got married that she was going to be chatelaine olantation and they would have children.
And she was going to be as—according to the rules of the book—a good wife to him.
She'd still be frigid and cold anhrew probably but she'd bood wife.
Then when he was going to throw the plantation away for idealistic folly all she—the only revenge she had was that.
At least he would have no children from her.
He'd have no wife from her.
And she hoped—Well Ike—excuse me sir.
And she hoped that he would—would make him grieve.Well Ike says here ... Did she realize when he was saying this that he did not mean itid not mean what?
... that he would go back to the land.
She must have understood he was not going to retract and take his heritage.
Yes I'm sure she was convinced of that no matter what he might have said.
Yes ma'am.
if she had been the kind of wife he needed and been able to give him love and companionship and had stuck by him and had children and haome for him do you think that his—that he would have ever compromised with his ideals?
After all he had no training no way of providing for her.ould say since we are supposing if she had been that sort of woman she would have understood his—his hatred of that condition.
She might have been practical enough to say "This is the way we'll do it.
We can't abandon these people.
But let's do it this way."
And he would have said "You're wiser than I.
Let's try it your way."
That's possibleould like to think that.
But he would have stuck to his—his position that "I will not profit from this which is—is wrong and sinful."
Yes sir.Sir one of the most interesting aspects of "The Bear" to me is the conflict between man and the wildernessould like to ask you if you intend for the reader to sympathize more with Old Ben and his conflict with hunters or with the hunters and their conflict with Old Benell not sympathize.
I—I doubt if—if the writer is asking anyone to sympathize to choose sides.
That is the reader's right.
What the writer is asking is compassion understanding that—that change must alter must happen and change is going to alter what was.
That no matter how fine anything seems it can't endure because it—once it stops—abandons motion it is dead.
It's to have compassion for the—for the anguish that—that the wilderness itself may have felt by being ruthlessly destroyed by axes by—by men who simply wanted to—to make that earth grow something they could sell forofit which brought into iondition based on an evil like human bondage.
It's not to—to choose sides at all just to compassionate the—the—the good splendid things which change must destroy the splendid fine things which arart of man's past too part of man's heritage too.
But they were obsolete and had to go.
But that's no need to—to not feel compassion for them simply because they were obsolete.
Yes sir.
is that what you meant by the ending of this then that change must destroy all goodnesshange if it is not controlled by wise people destroys sometimes more than it—it brings.
That—unless some wise person comes along in—in the—in the middle of the change and takes charge of it change can destroy what is irreplaceable.
If the reason for the change is—is base in motive.
That is to—to clear the wilderness just to make cotton land to raise cotton on a—on an agrarian economy of—of peonage slavery is—is base because it's not as good as that wilderness which it replaced.
But if in the end that makes more education for more people and more food for more people more of the—the good things of life—I mean by that to give man leisure to—to use what's up here instead of just leisure to ride around in automobiles then the—it was worth destroying the wilderness.
But if all—if all the destruction of the wilderness does is to give more people more automobiles just to ride around in then the wilderness was better.
Yes ma'am.
in "The Bear" does Boon Hogganbeck have some particular trait or characteristic that made him the choice of—of person to kill the bear rather than Sam Fathers or Ike or some of the older huntersell yes Boon had his size his physical size and strength.
He had the mentality ohild and he wouldn't stop to think "This may bittle dangerous to run in there."
He had the—the capacity to—to love that dog enough to—to risk being mauled to save that dog's life.
That Boon with his unreliability his lack of—of intellect had God-like attributes if he ever met the opportunity to show them.
And he met probably his great moment in life when he could use his strength and—and his capacity to be—be brave to—to save to protect the weak from the strong even though the weak was jusog.
Also Boon waescendant of the same Indian clan that Sam Fathers was descended from.
Sam Fathers whether Boon knew it or not was descended from the chief.
He was Boon's superior in the woods because he had better blood.
Boon was—Boon's Chickasaw ancestor was probably jusunter.
Sam's even though his mother waegro his father wahieing.
And maybe Boon was doing what he knew Sam expected him to do.
Yes sir.Inderstood you correctly earlier you said that you did not use any intentional symbolism in "The Bear."
But yet towards the end of the story—well after the end Ike appears from now on he's going to leaery Christ-like existence and he becomearpenter and was that not intentionalell not deliberately intentionalean this the—the symbolism is—is literary.
It'art of—of anyone's past background.
So these symbols will appear just as the way you—you pronounce your words appear.
You don't know where you learned to pronounce words the way you do because you—you inherited that or it came from your early environment and these symbols which are Christian symbols arart of the—the Christian background which all of us in this country came from.
That's whhink critics read into books what the writer didn't know was there because he reads from the same background of Christian symbolism which the writer unconsciously wrote from.
And I'm sure that these symbols are all there but the writer himself don't know it till somebody points them out to him.
Because he is too busy simply telling about people to have to hunt around to—to use symbols to tell about people with.
The symbols insert themselves just as the proper word does.
Because that iart of his culture part of his literary background.
Yes sir.What is the function of Boon's breakdown ...o function.
He had—had gone beyond even his strength the strain.
He had—he—at the last he killed Sam Fathers by Sam Father's command just aing would say to one of his—his faithful body servants when he has lost the war and lost the battle "Don't let my head fall into the enemy's hands."
Boon had simply exceeded his own emotional and physical strength.
He just stayed awake too long.
Yes sir.What significance do you attach to the dog Lion ... left out of the story?
Why wasn't the bear killed ...ell that's sort of like saying "How would Shakespeare have got along without his gravediggers."
That is it's more than atmosphere.
It's necessary to—to—to create the full complete atmospheric picture in which man faces the—the natural normal dilemmas of—of his condition.
That Lion was simply necessary just like the bear was necessary.
There was no intent that they should symbolize anything.
They were just necessary components toving dramatic story which approachelimax.He was just neededes yes.
Just like the boy was needed arotagonist on one side just as the bear was needed just as the wilderness was needed as—they're props to tell the—the story which was—a boy to face the adult world and to see how he copes with it.Because he waart of the wilderness ...ell the wilderness where the bear ran had not been tamed yet.
Men went into it but they didn't live there.
They went in to match their strength against the wilderness which was older and stronger than they were yes.
The edges of it would be gnawed up but—but where the bear ran was not tamed yet.
But when they went in to—to that bear country they had to accept the bear's conditions not theirs anymore.
The only advantage they had were guns.
And the boy who—he met the—the—the symbol of the wilderness hahance to use his gun.
He didn't use it.
He was testing himself.
Yes sir.
... extreme end of "The Bear" ... where Boon is at the base of the tree ... gun to shoot the squirrels he has up the tree.
Is that showing that Boon is unable to cope with modern instruments like the gun?
The only way he could kill something was by the way he killed the bear?
...gun and not being able to hit anything when he uses ito that to me was a—a promise of optimiselief of mine that—that man no matter how frail he is is tougher than anything that he can stand anything that Boon having served his purpose in this—the old bear's saga and Sam Father's finish was still going on he was still Boon.
If he were needed again by another Old Ben another Sam Fathers he would have served again.
That he was—that to me is a—a sign of—of optimism that man is pretty good after all that even his moments of heroism don't necessarily need to destroy.
Yes ma'am.
... of man's dilemma ... now would the terms of this dilemma in our current society ...is struggle is "Shalo whaan to—to get rid of whanow of evil?
Or shalay 'Well that's none of my business and I'll let it alonef whanow to be evil injustice worries me sust do something about it.
Or how cas frail am and as solitary am againsast weight of public opinion who wants to let this alonehat's his struggle and his dilemma and his dramatic moment in terms of—of story is—when he faces this problem this battle does he lick it or does it lick him?
If—if it beats his brains out does he still look good while he is having his head battered?
Or does he turn tail and run from it?
They are—they are his problems.
Wile as brave aant to be?
Wile as honest aant to be?
...
Yes that's right.
Yes he wants to do something about it.
Yes sir.
it seems like in the ending of "The Bear" when he breaks down and starts yelling "Get away!
Get away!
Don't toucne of them!
They're mine!
They're mine!"
...
Instead of taking that aort of an optimistic intentiohought of—thought of it more so aarning to man that he can not in the end conquer nature that in the end nature will win out and that in order to leaood lifan must be at peace with nature rather than trying to constantly conquer it.
Well I'm not too certain that man could—can be at peace with nature because nature ain't very peaceful itselfhink in—in this instance Boon—he did everything full out.
If it was something worthwhile and he could be convinced by someone he believed in that he should go full out at it he would.
Just as he—he went at the bear and just as he helped Sam Fathers to die.
He was hunting squirrels and he had got the squirrels up that tree and the gun as usual let him down.
If anything that's a—a contemptive commentary on the machine that man thinks he can depend on when he can't.
It lets him down.
And Boon's machine let him down.
But that hadn't frightened Boon.
He could fix that thing just as long as somebody else didn't come along witachine that did work and kill all his squirrels.
does the miscegenation and incest of Roth Edmunds in "Delta Autumn" completycle of incest and miscegenation begun by old McCaslin and only interrupted by the goodness of Buck and Buddy and Ike in the middlees it—it came home.
It—if you—if that's what you mean by complete the cycle yes it did.
Yes sir.
the purpose of having the annual—the annual hunt just a—just the opportunity to allow these people to commune again with nature ... natureo it was to go hunting.
They liked to go hunting  and that was—it ... that simple.... they were going to hunt deer—bear and deer—they were not going to hunt bear and deer but to keeearly rendezvous witear they did not intend to kill.
Well now that's—that's that little boy remember that has gone into the adult world with—with all the illusions of something fine and splendid.
The old people when they first went there they had that same thought but now they went back to hunt.
It could have—also they could go back because they liked it because they liked the—liked the freedom.
They liked the sense of—of atavistic desire to go back to the beginning.
Also they—for two weeks they were free of the women folk.
There were all sorts of reasons why they would like to go.
It could be summed up simply because they liked the two weeks in the bottom during the hunt.
They wouldn't have paused to dig out the other reasons as the little boy did.
They could have been there.
But those men would never meet on the street say "Now boys let's hook up the mules and go back to commune for two weeks with nature."
They'd say "Let's go back there and kill that big bear that's there."
audience laughteYes sir.Sir after Sam had taken—taken—captured Lion Boon took the dog.
Now why didn't Sam mind thatam waing.
He was going to have his—his hunter folks take care of the dogs and horses.
He turned the dog over to—troom.
Sam waing.
He wasn't going to sleep witog.
He'd let Boon do that.
Yes sir.Sir you said that this story you think comes out of your own background.
Was there reallog ... actual dog that might have inspired Lione usually had one dog of that—that general type in our pack of bear dogs.
He was a—usually part Airedale.
The hounds would—would trail the bear and would bay him.
And the Airedale would—would hold him there until the men on the horses could get up.
Lion as he is in the story iabrication but he's based on the—the dog that we would usually have in our pack always keep one of that sort.
Yes sir.Sir have you ever ... the idea of ...o not for meYes sir.I hope this is not too obviouuestion but this is not the sort of thing ... novels.
As we read your books we see dogs mules colored people white people Indians half-breeds who are brave.
Bravery—it permeates your work.
Could you say something about bravery in general?
Do you think that—thaan should feel that he has to be brave or do you think that men are brave by definition?
Do you think also—is there less bravery today than there was forty years agoon't think sohink there's—that bravery is like—like the water in the earth.
It—it don't diminish.
It might alter.
Sometimes it's clouds.
Sometimes it's—it's rivers in the land.
Sometimes it's back in the ocean again but it's the same quantity of water.
It's constant.
That—I would say that—that man falls into courage just as you walk along the street and fall into manhole that no—nobody possesses it at—at his beck and call always that he himself never knows whether he will be able to be brave or not.
Quite often he is to his astonishmenthink that some people feel better to believe or have proof that they are brave that they may do dangerous things just as you takrink.
It makes you feel good to know that you are brave.
Some people are content to—to believe that "I'm going be brave buin't going to go to much trouble to find out right now."
Buould say that the—the quantity of it is—ionstant factor ..onstant apportioning to individual people that too many things will have to do with—with why you're brave at one particular moment.
Too much goes into it.
Maybe somebody's watching you.
You want to look good so you're brave.
You might be scared to death but for the moment you're brave because you want to look good to—to your sweetheart or triend or to newspapers or whatever.One last questionemembeead most—a good bit of your work about—oh about six years aguess anead it without any particular direction in no particular sequencean remember sort of struggling through it and trying to figure out the genealogical table to figure out whose family the people belong to and all.
And then one daead "The Old Man.ever read The Wild Palmsnow it was published in conjunction with "The Old Man.ever read that.
But "The Old Manemember struck me because aemember basically it waery simple story.
The language was pretty straightforward.
There weren't very many people involved in it.
It was sort oice tight short noveuess.
And it was in—to me at that time aemember it was entirely—it struck me as being entirely unlike—I guess from the point of view of style if you want to use the term from anything else I'd read of yours—anlways was interested in how you thought about that particular piece of work in relation to the other things you've—you've written.
That's only half of—of another book.
They should never have been broken apart that way.
That's half chapter by chapter witook called The Wild Palms.
They should be read together arote them.
That is—is simply a—a—a background.
It'ounterpoint iugue.
And to me to—to break them to pieces is—is just as dull as—as listening to the left hand part of—of a—a piece of Beethoven or—or Bach.
It don't mean anything to me without both hands.
That was not my idea to do that.
That was the publisher's.
It was printed properly iook called The Wild Palms.
They were alternate chapters.
This was to emphasize and underline the other story.
One was the story of a—oan anoman who—who fell in love and—and were destroyed by it played against the background oan who got involved witoman and went through incredible trouble to get rid of her even to go back to the penitentiary to get rid of her.Thank you very muchThank you.
... he would ever find from her no understanding no—no chance ever to—to accept love or return love because she was incapable of it.
That's probably what he meant.Anondered why she laughed and laughed when ...he realized then that he was going to give up the land.
She married him because she was going to be chatelaine olantation.
And then she found he was going to give all that away and the only revenge she knew was to not—to deny him sexually that was the only triumph she had.
And she was going to make him suffer for that just as much as she could to get even with him.So that she intended from the beginning of her marriage to deny him this one thing that he had requested until it was useful in blackmailing ...ell she assumed when they got married that she was going to be chatelaine olantation and they would have children.
And she was going to be as—according to the rules of the book—a good wife to him.
She'd still be frigid and cold anhrew probably but she'd bood wife.
Then when he was going to throw the plantation away for idealistic folly all she—the only revenge she had was that.
At least he would have no children from her.
He'd have no wife from her.
And she hoped—Well Ike—excuse me sir.
And she hoped that he would—would make him grieve.Well Ike says here ... Did she realize when he was saying this that he did not mean itid not mean what?
... that he would go back to the land.
She must have understood he was not going to retract and take his heritage.
Yes I'm sure she was convinced of that no matter what he might have said.
Yes ma'am.
if she had been the kind of wife he needed and been able to give him love and companionship and had stuck by him and had children and haome for him do you think that his—that he would have ever compromised with his ideals?
After all he had no training no way of providing for her.ould say since we are supposing if she had been that sort of woman she would have understood his—his hatred of that condition.
She might have been practical enough to say "This is the way we'll do it.
We can't abandon these people.
But let's do it this way."
And he would have said "You're wiser than I.
Let's try it your way."
That's possibleould like to think that.
But he would have stuck to his—his position that "I will not profit from this which is—is wrong and sinful."
Yes sir.Sir one of the most interesting aspects of "The Bear" to me is the conflict between man and the wildernessould like to ask you if you intend for the reader to sympathize more with Old Ben and his conflict with hunters or with the hunters and their conflict with Old Benell not sympathize.
I—I doubt if—if the writer is asking anyone to sympathize to choose sides.
That is the reader's right.
What the writer is asking is compassion understanding that—that change must alter must happen and change is going to alter what was.
That no matter how fine anything seems it can't endure because it—once it stops—abandons motion it is dead.
It's to have compassion for the—for the anguish that—that the wilderness itself may have felt by being ruthlessly destroyed by axes by—by men who simply wanted to—to make that earth grow something they could sell forofit which brought into iondition based on an evil like human bondage.
It's not to—to choose sides at all just to compassionate the—the—the good splendid things which change must destroy the splendid fine things which arart of man's past too part of man's heritage too.
But they were obsolete and had to go.
But that's no need to—to not feel compassion for them simply because they were obsolete.
Yes sir.
is that what you meant by the ending of this then that change must destroy all goodnesshange if it is not controlled by wise people destroys sometimes more than it—it brings.
That—unless some wise person comes along in—in the—in the middle of the change and takes charge of it change can destroy what is irreplaceable.
If the reason for the change is—is base in motive.
That is to—to clear the wilderness just to make cotton land to raise cotton on a—on an agrarian economy of—of peonage slavery is—is base because it's not as good as that wilderness which it replaced.
But if in the end that makes more education for more people and more food for more people more of the—the good things of life—I mean by that to give man leisure to—to use what's up here instead of just leisure to ride around in automobiles then the—it was worth destroying the wilderness.
But if all—if all the destruction of the wilderness does is to give more people more automobiles just to ride around in then the wilderness was better.
Yes ma'am.
in "The Bear" does Boon Hogganbeck have some particular trait or characteristic that made him the choice of—of person to kill the bear rather than Sam Fathers or Ike or some of the older huntersell yes Boon had his size his physical size and strength.
He had the mentality ohild and he wouldn't stop to think "This may bittle dangerous to run in there."
He had the—the capacity to—to love that dog enough to—to risk being mauled to save that dog's life.
That Boon with his unreliability his lack of—of intellect had God-like attributes if he ever met the opportunity to show them.
And he met probably his great moment in life when he could use his strength and—and his capacity to be—be brave to—to save to protect the weak from the strong even though the weak was jusog.
Also Boon waescendant of the same Indian clan that Sam Fathers was descended from.
Sam Fathers whether Boon knew it or not was descended from the chief.
He was Boon's superior in the woods because he had better blood.
Boon was—Boon's Chickasaw ancestor was probably jusunter.
Sam's even though his mother waegro his father wahieing.
And maybe Boon was doing what he knew Sam expected him to do.
Yes sir.Inderstood you correctly earlier you said that you did not use any intentional symbolism in "The Bear."
But yet towards the end of the story—well after the end Ike appears from now on he's going to leaery Christ-like existence and he becomearpenter and was that not intentionalell not deliberately intentionalean this the—the symbolism is—is literary.
It'art of—of anyone's past background.
So these symbols will appear just as the way you—you pronounce your words appear.
You don't know where you learned to pronounce words the way you do because you—you inherited that or it came from your early environment and these symbols which are Christian symbols arart of the—the Christian background which all of us in this country came from.
That's whhink critics read into books what the writer didn't know was there because he reads from the same background of Christian symbolism which the writer unconsciously wrote from.
And I'm sure that these symbols are all there but the writer himself don't know it till somebody points them out to him.
Because he is too busy simply telling about people to have to hunt around to—to use symbols to tell about people with.
The symbols insert themselves just as the proper word does.
Because that iart of his culture part of his literary background.
Yes sir.What is the function of Boon's breakdown ...o function.
He had—had gone beyond even his strength the strain.
He had—he—at the last he killed Sam Fathers by Sam Father's command just aing would say to one of his—his faithful body servants when he has lost the war and lost the battle "Don't let my head fall into the enemy's hands."
Boon had simply exceeded his own emotional and physical strength.
He just stayed awake too long.
Yes sir.What significance do you attach to the dog Lion ... left out of the story?
Why wasn't the bear killed ...ell that's sort of like saying "How would Shakespeare have got along without his gravediggers."
That is it's more than atmosphere.
It's necessary to—to—to create the full complete atmospheric picture in which man faces the—the natural normal dilemmas of—of his condition.
That Lion was simply necessary just like the bear was necessary.
There was no intent that they should symbolize anything.
They were just necessary components toving dramatic story which approachelimax.He was just neededes yes.
Just like the boy was needed arotagonist on one side just as the bear was needed just as the wilderness was needed as—they're props to tell the—the story which was—a boy to face the adult world and to see how he copes with it.Because he waart of the wilderness ...ell the wilderness where the bear ran had not been tamed yet.
Men went into it but they didn't live there.
They went in to match their strength against the wilderness which was older and stronger than they were yes.
The edges of it would be gnawed up but—but where the bear ran was not tamed yet.
But when they went in to—to that bear country they had to accept the bear's conditions not theirs anymore.
The only advantage they had were guns.
And the boy who—he met the—the—the symbol of the wilderness hahance to use his gun.
He didn't use it.
He was testing himself.
Yes sir.
... extreme end of "The Bear" ... where Boon is at the base of the tree ... gun to shoot the squirrels he has up the tree.
Is that showing that Boon is unable to cope with modern instruments like the gun?
The only way he could kill something was by the way he killed the bear?
...gun and not being able to hit anything when he uses ito that to me was a—a promise of optimiselief of mine that—that man no matter how frail he is is tougher than anything that he can stand anything that Boon having served his purpose in this—the old bear's saga and Sam Father's finish was still going on he was still Boon.
If he were needed again by another Old Ben another Sam Fathers he would have served again.
That he was—that to me is a—a sign of—of optimism that man is pretty good after all that even his moments of heroism don't necessarily need to destroy.
Yes ma'am.
... of man's dilemma ... now would the terms of this dilemma in our current society ...is struggle is "Shalo whaan to—to get rid of whanow of evil?
Or shalay 'Well that's none of my business and I'll let it alonef whanow to be evil injustice worries me sust do something about it.
Or how cas frail am and as solitary am againsast weight of public opinion who wants to let this alonehat's his struggle and his dilemma and his dramatic moment in terms of—of story is—when he faces this problem this battle does he lick it or does it lick him?
If—if it beats his brains out does he still look good while he is having his head battered?
Or does he turn tail and run from it?
They are—they are his problems.
Wile as brave aant to be?
Wile as honest aant to be?
...
Yes that's right.
Yes he wants to do something about it.
Yes sir.
it seems like in the ending of "The Bear" when he breaks down and starts yelling "Get away!
Get away!
Don't toucne of them!
They're mine!
They're mine!"
...
Instead of taking that aort of an optimistic intentiohought of—thought of it more so aarning to man that he can not in the end conquer nature that in the end nature will win out and that in order to leaood lifan must be at peace with nature rather than trying to constantly conquer it.
Well I'm not too certain that man could—can be at peace with nature because nature ain't very peaceful itselfhink in—in this instance Boon—he did everything full out.
If it was something worthwhile and he could be convinced by someone he believed in that he should go full out at it he would.
Just as he—he went at the bear and just as he helped Sam Fathers to die.
He was hunting squirrels and he had got the squirrels up that tree and the gun as usual let him down.
If anything that's a—a contemptive commentary on the machine that man thinks he can depend on when he can't.
It lets him down.
And Boon's machine let him down.
But that hadn't frightened Boon.
He could fix that thing just as long as somebody else didn't come along witachine that did work and kill all his squirrels.
does the miscegenation and incest of Roth Edmunds in "Delta Autumn" completycle of incest and miscegenation begun by old McCaslin and only interrupted by the goodness of Buck and Buddy and Ike in the middlees it—it came home.
It—if you—if that's what you mean by complete the cycle yes it did.
Yes sir.
the purpose of having the annual—the annual hunt just a—just the opportunity to allow these people to commune again with nature ... natureo it was to go hunting.
They liked to go hunting  and that was—it ... that simple.... they were going to hunt deer—bear and deer—they were not going to hunt bear and deer but to keeearly rendezvous witear they did not intend to kill.
Well now that's—that's that little boy remember that has gone into the adult world with—with all the illusions of something fine and splendid.
The old people when they first went there they had that same thought but now they went back to hunt.
It could have—also they could go back because they liked it because they liked the—liked the freedom.
They liked the sense of—of atavistic desire to go back to the beginning.
Also they—for two weeks they were free of the women folk.
There were all sorts of reasons why they would like to go.
It could be summed up simply because they liked the two weeks in the bottom during the hunt.
They wouldn't have paused to dig out the other reasons as the little boy did.
They could have been there.
But those men would never meet on the street say "Now boys let's hook up the mules and go back to commune for two weeks with nature."
They'd say "Let's go back there and kill that big bear that's there."
audience laughteYes sir.Sir after Sam had taken—taken—captured Lion Boon took the dog.
Now why didn't Sam mind thatam waing.
He was going to have his—his hunter folks take care of the dogs and horses.
He turned the dog over to—troom.
Sam waing.
He wasn't going to sleep witog.
He'd let Boon do that.
Yes sir.Sir you said that this story you think comes out of your own background.
Was there reallog ... actual dog that might have inspired Lione usually had one dog of that—that general type in our pack of bear dogs.
He was a—usually part Airedale.
The hounds would—would trail the bear and would bay him.
And the Airedale would—would hold him there until the men on the horses could get up.
Lion as he is in the story iabrication but he's based on the—the dog that we would usually have in our pack always keep one of that sort.
Yes sir.Sir have you ever ... the idea of ...o not for meYes sir.I hope this is not too obviouuestion but this is not the sort of thing ... novels.
As we read your books we see dogs mules colored people white people Indians half-breeds who are brave.
Bravery—it permeates your work.
Could you say something about bravery in general?
Do you think that—thaan should feel that he has to be brave or do you think that men are brave by definition?
Do you think also—is there less bravery today than there was forty years agoon't think sohink there's—that bravery is like—like the water in the earth.
It—it don't diminish.
It might alter.
Sometimes it's clouds.
Sometimes it's—it's rivers in the land.
Sometimes it's back in the ocean again but it's the same quantity of water.
It's constant.
That—I would say that—that man falls into courage just as you walk along the street and fall into manhole that no—nobody possesses it at—at his beck and call always that he himself never knows whether he will be able to be brave or not.
Quite often he is to his astonishmenthink that some people feel better to believe or have proof that they are brave that they may do dangerous things just as you takrink.
It makes you feel good to know that you are brave.
Some people are content to—to believe that "I'm going be brave buin't going to go to much trouble to find out right now."
Buould say that the—the quantity of it is—ionstant factor ..onstant apportioning to individual people that too many things will have to do with—with why you're brave at one particular moment.
Too much goes into it.
Maybe somebody's watching you.
You want to look good so you're brave.
You might be scared to death but for the moment you're brave because you want to look good to—to your sweetheart or triend or to newspapers or whatever.One last questionemembeead most—a good bit of your work about—oh about six years aguess anead it without any particular direction in no particular sequencean remember sort of struggling through it and trying to figure out the genealogical table to figure out whose family the people belong to and all.
And then one daead "The Old Man.ever read The Wild Palmsnow it was published in conjunction with "The Old Man.ever read that.
But "The Old Manemember struck me because aemember basically it waery simple story.
The language was pretty straightforward.
There weren't very many people involved in it.
It was sort oice tight short noveuess.
And it was in—to me at that time aemember it was entirely—it struck me as being entirely unlike—I guess from the point of view of style if you want to use the term from anything else I'd read of yours—anlways was interested in how you thought about that particular piece of work in relation to the other things you've—you've written.
That's only half of—of another book.
They should never have been broken apart that way.
That's half chapter by chapter witook called The Wild Palms.
They should be read together arote them.
That is—is simply a—a—a background.
It'ounterpoint iugue.
And to me to—to break them to pieces is—is just as dull as—as listening to the left hand part of—of a—a piece of Beethoven or—or Bach.
It don't mean anything to me without both hands.
That was not my idea to do that.
That was the publisher's.
It was printed properly iook called The Wild Palms.
They were alternate chapters.
This was to emphasize and underline the other story.
One was the story of a—oan anoman who—who fell in love and—and were destroyed by it played against the background oan who got involved witoman and went through incredible trouble to get rid of her even to go back to the penitentiary to get rid of her.Thank you very muchThank you.
... one of the tools.
That'articular saw hammer that the particular carpenter feels he can do the most with that he might not like the violence either.
It's simply because he does not havetter tool to show man in his tragic or comic moments inside the predicament.
That is the dramatic story is man is faced—the frail fragile creature of flesh and bone mostly water iamshackle universe stuck together with electricity faced with problems which are usually bigger than he is.
The story is does he face it?
Does it lick him?
Or does he beat it?
Or if it licks him does he get beaten to his knees still as Hemingway says "Looking good."
Thahink is—is what anyone writes about.
It's man that is striving to be braver than he might be more honest than he might be to be compassionate.And it's so important in twentieth century more than in other centuries ... to write about thisell no it's always been importanthink that's what makes man endure and what will cause him to endure that he is capable of wanting to be brave and to be honest and to be compassionate and he will last.
He's outlasted his dinosaurs.
He'll outlast his atom bomb.
My belief is that the last sound on earth when this earth ied rock freezing will be two folks building an airship and fussing about where they're going next.
Man is all right.
You can't beat him.
No there'll be three.
The other one will be writinook about it.
Yes ma'am.
when you begin to writovel do you have it planned from beginning to endot always.
It's—it'ittle more instinctive than that.
It could begin with a—a character.
It could begin with an anecdote.
And out of that the book grows in order to explain why the person got in that particular pro—complexity.
I—some people work from plots buever could do it just likever did do any research.
I—it's more fun to me to—to invenhink than to hunt uact.
But—and this—I wish it were as simple as that but it's—it's not.
You—the writehink never knows just where that germ came from that started him off.
Yes sir.Well in some of our writing classes at Chapel Hill we have—well we've been discussing with—the ways you go about writinovel anhort story.
And—and one of the theories we've been dealing with is thahort story is planned outlined from beginning to end whereas iovel—it seems that most novelists tend to just find themselves as they go along.
Do you find that's true don't quite agree with that.
If you mean by planned outlined intattern—That's for short stories.
Yes.And the novel you just kind of find the novel and yourself in it or—  Nhink they both come from the same sourceate the—the ability to write in three degrees.
The first degree the highest of course is the poet.
He can say in—say it in fourteen linesate next the short story writer.
He can say it in ten pagesate last the novelist because it takes him three or four hundred pages.
But it—that'atter of working.
If you work from notes from something physical that you can look at in front of you then you work that way no matter what you're writing.
Maybe the poet does.
If you plan it all inside before you put down anything then that's the way that you do it novel short story or sonneton't think that—that could be a—a procedurule for procedure.
Actually the novelist wishes he could say it in ten pages.
In fact all that any writer wants to do is to say it in one absolute word the poet the short story writer or the novelist.
If he could state some moving tragic fundamental eternal truth of man's struggle within man's heart in one word that's what he wants to do.
He'll never do it and that's why he's never bored.
He never touches satiation in his vocation.
There's always some reason to get up tomorrow morning and rub your hands and go back to workYes sir.Apropos of the last question asked so far anderstood it and apropos of the first question askeonder if you would care to commenittle more broadly upon the effect of formal education on the creative writer hope I'm not going to step on any toes now.
audience laughteon't believe that formal education ever madriter or ever hurt himhinriter is omnivorous.
He will use someday any experience.
That formal education has taught him one very valuable quality which is mental discipline.
He could teach himself mental discipline.
He wouldn't have to have formal education for that.
Formal education simply simplifies his field of research.
That he is offered by experts in—in the simplest way knowledge which he probably very likely will need and will use.
Without formal education he would have to dig it out himself.
Buon't think that formal education could takan and turn him intriter.
Yes sir.ew minutes ago you mentioned personal experience as one of the sources including that in books that you have read.
According to that what is your opinion of such writers as Stephen Crane and Dreiser and Frank Norris in relation to your own worko writer is really interested in who wrote the book.
He's interested only in the book.
Sould probably find more influence of characters of Crane's on what I've written than influence from Crane himself.
That the only thing that's interesting to the writer is how someone else has taken man and from those three sources has created him ilightly new or slightly awry—awry light in his comic or tragic struggle within his own environment or his own dilemma.
Everything the writer has read from the telephone book up has influenced him.
He's amoral omnivorous.
He will rob and steal from any source because he is not only willing but if anyone after him robs and steals from him he's flattered.
That means that he did it pretty well if somebody else wants to steal it.
Yes ma'am.
with all this talk of conformity particularly literary conformity don't you suppose that there's either less of it than talk of it has taken for granted or that it's ...ould you ask me that again please Ma'am?
In other words don't you think there's less literary conformity than is constantly talked abouth.
Well I—I don't think there's any such thing as literary conformity.
The pressure to conform is not to be literary.
It's to belong to an economic strata.
That litera—literature can't be conformed.
The only restriction it submits to is that of language.
And that's only in the terms of the reader.
That no first-rate writer is going to—to bother about writing like Hemingway or like Mark Twain.
He's too busy.
He's writing about people.
If anything—any trick Hemingway learned is good he will steal it from Hemingway or from Twain but he's not going to conform anybody's school of—of literature.
He's writing about people.
And if he belongs tchool of literature it's because they are pleasant folks to talk to and drink with until two and three o'clock in the morning not to write likeYes sir.Speaking of language you said that the two great influences on the western world and writing are the Bible and the Greek myths and that the latter are dying out such as in terms that we speak of cultures or parts of cultures dying out and yet it's feasible thariter understands those myths and works with them.
It'enuous question but is it still legitimate for him to express himself in—in an old outmoded form of language such as myths even though he's pretty sure that people who read him will not understand him at least right awayf he feels that that is the best way for him to—to isolate man in the motion of being alive inside his dilemma yes by all means.
He can use any—any means any method he likes.
But if he is going to write just to use means or method of style he's simply writing rhetoric and he would be better off at somethinittle more fun than that.
That the—the story itself compels its symbolism compels its—its stylhink.
That the writer aaid simply reaches behind him with one hand while he's writing with the other and drags ouymbol which he thinks is exactly the scrap of wood he needs to make that joint with which is in my opinion perfectly legitimate.
If he is dealing simply with man in motion then he has obeyed all the—the compulsion of his craft on him.
He can use whatever method he likes just as long as he sticks to the primary compulsion which is to deal with man in motion in a—a believablredible dramatic way.
Not to judge simply to describe man struggling within his predicament in his unceasing conflict with himself with his fellows with his environment.
Any method he uses in my opinion is all right.
Yes ma'am.You tell us in Absalom that Miss Rosa writes poetry and I've always been curious about what kind of poetry Miss Rosa ....
It would probably have been gothic love poetry fourth-rate.
audience laughteYes ma'am.What do you think of the dramatizations that have been made of your work for the movies and for the play coming out next year saw Intruder in the Dusthought that was a—a pretty good picture.
It waood deal like my book.
The otherever saw.
That play which will be in New York next—next fall is—is the warote it.
That hasn't been changed.
That was—was sections oook that was told in play form because that seemed to me the best way to tell the story of man struggling in his dilemma.
Ssed play form.
The otheraven't seen because—well I'd done the besould with that book anas interested in writing another one which would be bettehought anust didn't have time to go to see it.
And then picture shows come at the wrong time of day for me.
It's—that's the time of daike to—to be at home and havrink or two and then eat supper and sit down and smoke and read fohile not to go out to the picture show.
Yes'm.
... you often talk about man's condition and man's dilemma anear people ... more poignant in the South ...o that's simply because the writer to save time can write about what he knows best.
Then there's less chance of somebody saying "Uh uh you're wrong.
That—folks don't do that in Keokuk."
... the same ... for your ideasehink that people are the same everywhere.
Their problems their immediate problems are different but their—their struggle within—within the—the fundamental simple human truths is the same everywherhink.
One writes about his own native land simply because that saves him having to do research to keep people from checking up on him.
That it's—it's easier.
It saves—saves time.
He's writing about something that's familiar that he has—well you might say not only seen but smelled too.
Yes ma'am.Does that mean ihort story like "Dry September" the situation is ..
Yes.
In which a—a—a woman in that condition of frustration after menopause or about menopause could have caused that sort of tragedy.
It wouldn't necessarily have to have a—a—a colored note in it.
Not necessarily that same story but she could have caused that same grief injustice crime.
Yes sir.Pertinent to that I'd like to ask why is it that Mississippi seems so very active iiterary way and yet we don't find the same phenomenon in New Jersey?
Well that's—that's because Mississippi is in the South and New Jersey's in the North.
audience laughtehink—I think that the wisest thing any nation can do when it gets itself into any sort oconomic muddle is to pick out some rich nation and declare war on it and get licked and then be supported.
The folks in the South write because the North has supported us ever since 1865.
We had plenty of time to write.Would you comment on this?
It would seem to me in talking to other people about your work that—the ladies in Richmond this class southern ladies in general do not know your work as well as people in other parts of the country in Europe.
Have you observed that?
Do you think that's true think that's because everybody in the South is writing.
Nobody has time to read anything.
Yes sir.Sir you speak of finishinovel and then sitting down to writetter one.
Do you feel that your last book is—whatever it is is the best that you've done to datean?
Taken at any timeo sirhink to the writer there's no good better best.
It's got to be the best or it's nothing.
And none of them are good enough to suit meon't—aaid the writer don't givamn what anybody else thinks about this book.Yeah.
It ain't good enough to suit me so I'm gonna write another one.
And iive another hundred years maybe I'll do it.
I—I probably won't but I'll keep on trying.
But the work is—never suits the—the writer.
That's why it's the—the happiest of all vocations because you never touch satiation.
You're never bored.
There's something to get up to and go to work at tomorrow.
Yes ma'am.
I've been puzzling since asking my question.
What did you mean when you said that Joyce was electrocutednly that he had a—a tremendous talent.
He tried too hard to put the whole tragic history of man's struggle within his dilemma on the head oinhink that is—ieeling that every—every writer every artist has thaill be here only foery short time and this—this tragic beautiful dilemma of mankind is so moving thaust put it down anay not live long enough to finish the book so I'll try to do it in one sentence one word.
Joyce was trying to do it all in one English sentence which was Ulysses and in one English word which was Finnegans Wake.
Yes sir.Do you feel thaood writer should necessarily begionalist in the sense that he should write about those things that he knows beste is writing about people and people in my opinion are not regional.
They are universal.
They—the same hopes aspirations tragedies are universal everywhere no matter what color nor what race.
The writer is regional only in the sense that he is using something that he is familiar with to save himself the time of research.
He is not trying to begional writer when he writes about the East Tennessee mountains or about California.
He is simply using the material that he is most familiar with to save himself the trouble of having to read up Chamber of Commerce brochures on Portland Oregon for instance.
Yes sir.Where did you first reallyget your—get your interest in Indians?
Was it from relics or living near them in Mississippi or—hat'art of—of my culture my North Mississippi culture.
Our country is—compared to the country east of the mountains is—is—was frontier onlundred years ago.
Remnants of Chickasaw families still live.
They're still my neighbors.
Some are—are—are mixed with Negroes.
Others are mixed with white people.
The traditions are still there.
There—in my childhood boyhood there were old men that could remember having heard their fathers tell them about the old days.
The Indian names are still on the creeks and branches.
The old roads the old hilltops still have the Indian names with the tribal significance.
Yes ma'am.
... worertain number of hours aime or do you wait for inspiration don't have to wait for inspiration if we can use that term.
My trouble now is to—to keep from—to find some good reason not to workon't like to workut it off as long aan.
When the demon begins to worry me and nag me too much theill sit down and write.
Buever have used any system though some people do.
Just like I've never kept notesill put off the work of—by any meanan think of.
Then when I've got to get it donill sit down and writatch of it san take ofeek and not work.
I'm lazy.
I'm sure that we all join in thanking you for being with us today.
Well thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of the seminar committee maelcome you to this twenty-sixth Washington and Lee seminar in literature.
The committee wishes me also to express our appreciation to the University of Virginia for this gracious loan today of their most distinguished writer-in-residence.
We are especially indebted to Professors  andwho have accompanied him here.
Our speaker intends to read from his latest novel The Town and at the conclusion of that he will welcome questions from you all.
It would be presumptuous indeed for me to attempt any formal introduction of our speaker today but it is certainly my very great privilege to present to yof Oxford Mississippi.
I'm an amateur at thison't thinavery good voice and ion't speak loud enough would you please tell mehere iidge; you drive on beyond Seminary Hill and in time you come upon iild unhurried farm road presently mounting to cross the ridge and on to join the main highway leading from Jefferson to the world.
And now looking back and down you see all Yoknapatawpha in the dying last of day beneath you.
There are stars now just pricking out as you watch them among the others already coldly and softly burning; the end of day is one vast green soundless murmur up the northwest toward the zenith.
Yet it is as though light were not being subtracted from earth drained from earth backward and upward into that cooling green but rather had gathered pooling for an unmoving moment yet among the low places of the ground so that ground earth itself is luminous and only the dense clumps of trees are dark standing darkly and immobile out of it.
Then as though at signal the fireflies—lightning-bugs of the Mississippi child's vernacular—myriad and frenetic random and frantic pulsing; not questing not quiring but choiring as if they were tiny incessant appeaseless voices cries words.
And you stand suzerain and solitary above the whole sum of your life beneath the incessant ephemeral spangling.
First is Jefferson the center radiating weakly its puny glow into space; beyond it enclosing it spreads the County tied by the diverging roads to that center as is the rim to the hub by its spokes yourself detached as God Himself for this moment above the cradle of your nativity and of the men and women who made you the record and chronicle of your native land proffered for your perusal in ring by concentric ring like the ripples on living water above the dreamless slumber of your past; you to preside unanguished and immune above this miniature of man's passions and hopes and disasters—ambition and fear and lust and courage and abnegation and pity and honor and sin and pride all bound precarious and ramshackle held together by the web the iron-thin warp and woof of his rapacity but withal yet dedicated to his dreams.
They are all here supine beneath you stratified and superposed osseous and durable with the frail dust and the phantoms—the rich alluvial river-bottom land of old Issetibbeha the wild Chickasaw king with his Negro slaves and his sister's son called Doom who murdered his way to the throne and legend said (record itself said since there were old men in the county in my own childhood who had actually seen it) stole an entire steamboat and had it dragged intact eleven miles overland to convert intalace properly to aggrandise his state; the same fat black rich plantation earth still synonymous of the proud fading white plantation names whether we—I mean of course they—ever actually ownelantation or not Sutpen and Sartoris and Compson and Edmonds and McCaslin and Beauchamp and Grenier and Habersham and Holston and Stevens and De Spain generals and governors and judges soldiers (even if only Cuban lieutenants) and statesmen failed or not and simple politicians and over-reachers and just simple failures who snatched and grabbed and passed and vanished name and face and all.
Then the roadless almost pathless perpendicular hill-country of McCallum and Gowrie and Frazier and Muir translated intact with their pot stills and speaking only the old Gaelic and not much of that from Culloden to Carolina then from Carolina to Yokpatawpha still intact and not speaking much of anything except now they called the pots "kettles" though the drink (evean remember this) was still usquebaugh; then and last on to where Frenchman's Bend lay beyond the southeastern horizon cradle of Varners and ant-heap for the northeast crawl of Snopes.
And you stand there—you the old man already white-headed (because it doesn't matter if they call your gray hairs premature because life itself is always premature which is why it aches and anguishes) and pushing forty onlew years from forty—while there rises up to you proffered up to you the spring darkness the unsleeping darkness which although it is of the dark itself declines the dark since dark is of the little death called sleeping.
Because look how even though the last of west is no longer green and all of firmament—firmament is now one unlidded studded slow-wheeling arc and the last of earth-pooled visibility has drained away there still remains one faint diffusion since everywhere you look about the dark panorama you still see them faint as whispers the faint and shapeless lambence of blooming dogwood returning loaned light to light as the phantoms of candles would.
And you the old man standing there while there rises to you about you suffocating you the spring dark peopled and myriad two and two seeking never at all solitude but simply privacy the privacy decreed and created for them by the spring darkness the spring weather the spring which an American poeine onoman and so she knows called girls' weather and boys' luck.
Which was not the first day at all not Eden morning at all because girls' weather and boys' luck is the sum of all the days the cup the bowl proffered once to the lips in youth and then no more; proffered to quench or sip or drain that lone one time and even that sometimes premature too soon.
Because the tragedy of life is it must be premature inconclusive and inconcludable in order to be life; it must be before itself in advance of itself to have been at all.
Any questions please don't hesitate.
Yes sir.
are you working oew novel at this timees sir.
The—the curse and the pleasure of beinriter is you never get done.
You're always working at somethinghink that's why it's the best vocation of all because you never touch satiety.
You're never bored.
There's always something to wake up for tomorrow morning.
And so any writer is always working.
He never finishes work.
He won't live that long.Is The Town the second part orilogyes sir.
The third one will be called the The Mansion.
That will be the story of the family of Snopeses.
That's the one I'm working at now.What do you consider your best novel think that my feeling is the feeling that all writers have.
None of them are quite good enough.
They are—they are failures.
He has done the best he can with it.
It wasn't quite good enough to suit him.
He doesn't care what anybody else thinks about it.
It's got to please himself and so he is going to write another one tomorrow.
And he will keep on planning to write that other one tomorrow as long as he lives.
Saven't written the one thahink is good enough to suit me yet.
audience laughtehink the only way that the writer can—can measure can gauge his work is by the one that cost him the most anguish and trouble just as the—the parent haenderness for the—the afflicted child.
The one thahink of with the most tenderness is the one that caused me the most trouble.
That is the most unsatisfactory because it—it was trying to match what seemed to me the—the finest dream and it failed.
Yes sir.When you say it doesn't satisfy ... what would be the ideal literary work?
In other words what would be the aim oiterary ...he aim of course is—is unattainable which is why it will always be an aimhink it's to take—to take man an instance of man in his struggle within his predicament—to isolate it in the most moving instant which one can so that in that single work there will be the—the whole history of the human heart all the struggle and anguish of—of—of man's heart to be in one picture one piece of music one book.
That's impossible to do.
That's why the artist has—is the luckiest of all occupations.
He has something that he—that's worth devoting his—in his opinion his life to that he knows he will never touch and will never be bored with.
what American writers do you enjoy reading enjoy reading all of them anhink all writers agree with me except  we'll say.
I—I think that any writer must have an insatiable curiosity about people and fiction books are simply the records of man in the moments of his—his triumphs or disasters told by experts.
For that reasooubt if any writer has very much judgment about what he reads.
He will read anything.
As he gets older he will go back to certain books to certain characters as he would go into another town say twenty five miles away to spend an afternoon with an old friend.
That to the writer it doesn't matter who wrote that book san't speak of books in terms of who wrote them but there are books thaill always like thaoved wheas twenty-one years old thaill still go back to.
Yes sir.Could you say something about ... On The Road ... Kerouac ...he sad thing abouriter—as he gets old he reads less and less.
The books thaead are the booknew wheas twenty-one years old unless someone says "This iood book.
You will like it.
Read it."
And so this book you speak oaven't read yetntend to buaven't read it yet.
The only work ooung man I'm at all familiar with is Salinger.
But I—I intend to and I'm ashamed thaave not read it yet buill do thathink that—that the pleasure in reading is—is inexhaustible too that one should read and one missereat deal of pleasure simply because he is not familiar with the book.
He hasn't seen that book.
Also living ao I'm a—I consider writing my hobby not my trade.
I'armer actually and the peoplnow are not literary people anon't keep up with these books.
Sir have you read any of the elaborate critical analyses of your own works ...o siron't read thatrefer to read fiction.
Sir I'd like to know ... What is your opinion of ithat in moving pictures?
Long Hot Summer.aven't seen that.
I'm not trying to be—be funny about it.
It's simply because the writer has done the best he can with his book.
He works in complete isolation and solitude.
To makoving picture or—oheater play—cannot be done that way.
That is a—a communal business.
The actor gives something to it.
The director gives something to it.
And whatever the—the moving picture does to that book it can't change whaid.
It may—it may improve it but what it improves its result will be something different from whaid.
And that's one reason aneckon the other reason is in my hometown the picture show begins at seven o'clock in the evening and that's the wrong time for me to go anywhere.
That's wheike to be at home and havrink or two and something to eat and then smoke fohile.
Yes sir.Would you care to comment on the writing you've done while you were in Hollywoodt was a—a pleasant way to make some moneyid it mainly becausnoirector.
He raises and breeds horses and he has an airplane which he would let me fly wheeeded one.
He—we hunt and fish together.
And when he is makinicture and he gets in trouble with it and thinkight be able to do something about it he sends for me.
That's all the moving picture work I've done.
It's not my—my cup of tea actually it's—for the reason I've stated.
That it iatter oot of people working together when the—the writer has to get off into solitude and isolation to do the work.
Anever could well you might say take it seriously.
Even the money wasn't something to be taken seriously.
It was too much for anybody raised in Mississippi to see all at once.
Do you consider Salinger to be one of our better writers ... was impressed with one book of his.
It seemed to me that it showed a—it's noault it's an evil that the writer has got to—to arm himself against—which is the pressure of our culture to compel everyone to belong to something troup.
It's difficult to be an individual in our culturehink that whaaw in—in that book waragedy which iay represented Salinger's own tragedy.
There was a—a—a young man intelligenittle more sensitive than most who simply wanted to love mankind and when he tried to break into mankind to love mankind man wasn't there.
That to me was the tragedy of that book.
That to me is—is the threat which all the young writers nowadays have got to be on guard against the pressure to relinquish submerge individuality the "me" intass of "us."
Anhink that—that any first-rate writing has been in terms of the individual who even in the moil and teem of the world was still "me" "myself."
He got his—his elbows skinned and his head bumped now and then but just with other heads and other elbows not with machinery.
There was nothing in the teem and moil of—of the world to destroy his—his soul by compressing him into a—a relinquishment of the "I am."
Yes sir.Do you think the novel ... would say it—it would go through phases like any other form of life or motion.
It's got to be in motion.
It's got to change.
The only alternative to change is stasis which is death.
And it—it will change yes.
It may go into another medium.
The novel may go into something visual into—to moving pictures.
But the novel as a—a—a quality will not change as long as—as people are trying to record man's victories and defeats in terms of the recognizable human heart.
Let's say that aut it the highest form of writing is the—the poem.
The poet has taken that—that tragic beautiful moment of man's struggle within his dilemma and put it into fourteen lines.
The second highest is the short story writer who has been able to do it in ten pages.
The novelist is the failure.
He'ailed poet.
It took him three hundred pages to isolate that tragic beautiful moving dilemma victory or defeat of fragile invincible man in his dilemma.
So the novel may change but its—it will never vanish auality in culture.
Yes sir.
John Steinbeck says that in America the writer iittle below the acrobat anittle above the seal anonder what you thought about that?
...
Non't rate the writer quite between the acrobat and the seal as Steinbeck saidhink that the fact that the writer in this country is—is treated witlightly cavalier treatment might be good for him because one thing that the writer must have in order to bood writer is humility.
He must not take himself too seriously.
He must take what he is doing with complete seriousness but he mustn't take what he does with very much seriousness.
He must keep himself an amateur.
And so that may be pretty good for him.
Maybe if—if this country gave writers more kudos and more recognition then they'd spend all their time walking around with their chests swelled up seeing who was looking at me now.
But they wouldn't work.
Buon't thinould rate—you can't rate anyone dealing with something as intangible as—as the human spirit.
It's impossible to rate him unless you are going to look on his rating with the finance company he is buying his refrigerator or his car from.
Yes sir.
have you done any hunting and fishing ...?
Yes siave done some quail shooting up near Warrenton with some friends there and two days agent up into the Blue Ridge on Mormon's River after troutave been up the headwaters of the Rapidan buave not been in Virginia in the fall enough to do much hunting.Sir—  Yes sir.When you are writinook ... very broad scope ...hink the writer is writing primarily for himself.
He really don't carontinental whether anybody else reads it or not.
That he has while—while alive he has—has seen man in—with all his baseness his follragile web of—of bones and flesh mostly water iamshackle universe stuck together with electricity who—and yet he has the faith to be braver than he thinks he can be to be more honorable than he thinks he can be.
He has had pity and compassion when he didn't know he was going to do it.
He has met problems bigger than himself and he has tried to solve them.
Maybe he got his brains beaten out but he still tried.
The artist is not trying to deliveessage.
He is simply—has been moved so by thin frail fragile man in his dilemma faced with things so much bigger and tougher and stronger than he yet still trying to do something to solve his problem.
That it's worth isolating in some tragic and moving moment to get down on paper.
Then he worries about if somebody else might read it.
At the moment he simply has seen something so beautiful so moving so important to himself that he wants to put it down lest he forget it.
After that comes the thought somebody else might read this.
In my own cashinrote for ten or fifteen years before it ever occurred to me that strangers might read it.
Yes sir.... the South has been for the last fifty years one of the most backward areas ... financially and in many other ways.
The schools also are not considered by most people to be as good as in other areas.
But yet your own state of Mississippi and the South in general have produced most ... greater novelists ..onder if you care to comment on this ...ne reason is that there's so many folks in Mississippi that can't read that they have to write.
audience laughteould say that's—that's not true only in Mississippi.
I'd say that that's true almost throughout the—what we think of as the Southelieve ieration anad struggled along anasn't doing too good thaould pick out some big rich country and declare war on them and let them lick me and then they'd have to support me for the rest of my life.
Anhink that—that maybe with the North having supported us since 1865 we've had plenty of time to write.
Yes sir.Did you havertain style that you would more or less use ...?
on't like my style eitherhink that— What I'm trying to say is thahink that no writer has got time to bother too much about writing style or writing rhetoric.
If he does he has probably got very little to say that the story he's telling—he is trying to isolate this moment of man's struggle in the most moving way he can.
And he will try style.
He'll try metaphor.
He'll try symbolism to—to isolate that in the most moving way he can possibly do it.
So the—in my opinion the work itself creates its own style.
That when it's done the writer can look back and say "This is clumsyisould think oetter way to do that."
But he can't.
He has done the best he could with it.
To get all he can into it.
It's—well he has a—as we all do an awareness of death that he will not be here forever that—that the end can be for him tomorrow.
He has been troubled and moved so much by what he's seen of man's struggle that he wants to get that on paper and he's afraid that if he puts it off he will die before he does it.
He in effect is like the man that's trying to carve the Lord's Prayer on the head oin.
He's trying to put everything into one book one page—the perfect thing would be to put all that history and anguish into one word which you can't do.
And the fumbling with style with metaphor symbolism is simply his desperate frantic attempt to get the beauty he has seen by simply being alive down on paper before he—before the lightning strikes.
So he is—he might—that's why he could hate his style too but this was the best he could do.
That if he could do that over again he is convinced he could do it betterhink every writer believes that that if he could turn time back until this day last year that book would better book.
Of course it wouldn't be but he believes that.
He can't do it so he writes another book tomorrow.
But he wants to be as lucid as pure as light or clear water itself.
And when it gets moiled and turgid he is sorry.
He grieves over that.
Though—of course he don't have to read it anymore.
That's one advantage—  Yes ma'am.Is writinompulsion for you or could you stop if you decided toelould like to say "Suran take it or leave it" buon't believe thathink that—that any writer is—is ridden bemon.
That he really can't help himself.
That he will keep on writing as long as he lives.
But he—he is not so conscious of being driven bemon to no destination.
He is convinced that he will—will make the—the perfect work so that as long as men live after him they will see that work as perfect and will remember him.
That maybe what any artist is doing is simply writing "Kilroy was here" on the wall of the last oblivion before he passes through it and beyond it.
Yes sir.Sir aoutherner anan who writes about the South can you give us your views of the Supreme Court decision?
audience murmur  That's sort of got out of fiction hasn't it?
audience laughteould say it was something that—that had to—to come.
There was a—the dean of the law school at the University of Mississippi said ten twelve years ago that in time the Supreme Court would—would hand down that opinion.
Nobody believed him.
It's—it's our fault.
If we had—had given the Negrhance to find whether or not he can be equal there wouldn't have been any need for it.
It has set relations between the races back for some time but it had to come.
It's our fault.
We could have prevented it.
Yes sir.... to create your charactersaave the first part of that again?
...he writer is—has got to be born with curiosity about people more than anything elsehought at one time it took talent but now I'm not so surehink he has got to have ruthlessness to destroy what is not absolutely right in his opinion.
He's got to have industry to do it over and over again.
He's got to have curiosity and insight.
Curiosity and insight to wonder why man does what he doeshink that—that he—he doesn't need experience personal experience to write about people.
Personal experience—as far as man goes can come from the books he reads.
But certainly the—the writer takes from every experience of any sort he's ever had.
He—he robs and steals from everything he's heard or seen or read.
He's amoral but he's perfectly willing for anyone after him to rob and steal from him.
He has the three you might say reservoirs that what he writes comes from.
One is that experience.
One is observation.
The other is imagination.
And nobody's to say just how much comes from what.
But the imagination can carry the load.
There was one blind man who waretty good writer.
You don't have to really experience nor even read.
You can listen and the imagination.
...
Yes sir.You said the—the writer is somewhat unappreciated amoral afteashion and trying to capturoment in the struggle of man but at least I'm ... in some of your work ..iterary ... to say something morehink especially of the—the story "The Bear" whicdmirreat deal.
The trappings of that story ... trying to say something more ...
I'm wondering ... whether despite the trappings ... if you feel this is basicallhristian vision ohristian viewpoint that you represent can't sayhink the writer is too busy writing about man in his dilemma his predicament.
Of course he writes out of—of the background the reservoir of his own culture and naturally in—a—a Christian anouthern culture the—the—the symbolism of Christianity and of the southern culture will appear.
That is any—any man is really writing—he's still writing his own biography.
He doesn't need to—to hunt around for—for symbolism any more than he needs to—to hunt around foackground from which to—against which to—to see these imaginary people that he's trying to put down on paper.
That was something that he inherited that he grew up with that came from his—his heredity and from his environment.
But the writer himself is too busy telling about amazing incalculable marvelous man struggling within the dilemma of the human heart to bother too much about messages or symbols oYes sir.
when you begin to write one of your books have you already predetermined what is going to happen or do you make up some of the details as you go alongt begins witeed.
That seed could be anecdote.
It could bituation.
It could bharacter.
Then you've got to explain how that situation came to be.
You've got to explain where that character came from.
And the first thing you know you've got some more people in there explaining the situation and the character.
Then they all stand up and—on their feet and begin to move and all you've got to do is after that is to trot along behind them and put down what they do and say.
That you can—you can invent the finest most watertight plot you can think of.
You get these people into it and if they are human unpredictable people they won't caroot about that plot.
They'll go off and teltory of their own.
You can keep your plot.
They don't want it.
Yes ma'am.
did you find Absalom Absalomery difficult novel to writees'm it—it was difficult.
I—I worked on that next hardest to The Sound and Fury aemember.
Yeorked on that foear and then put it away and wrote another book and then the story still wouldn't let me alone—I came back to it.
Yes that was very difficult.
There waot of rewriting in that.
Yes sir.
I've heard it reported that you've said in the past that Sanctuary was written aotboiler ... Do you care to comment on thises it wasad—had been writing as an amateur and havinot of fun at it.
Then all ouddeound myself married anould neeittle money anhoughight write something to makittle money with shought of the most horrific storould and wrote it.
Sent it in to the publisher.
He said "Good Lord man."
This was nineteen—in the nineteen twenties when you couldn't say the sort of things in books you can now.
He said "If we print this we'll both be in jail."
So he put it away anoob and didn't need money too muchrote two more books which were printed and then one daot the galley for Sanctuary anead it and it was so bad because it was basely conceived tharote him and said that "we'll just burn this up and forget about it."
He said "Well I—I have had plates stamped for it.aid "Well then I'll rewrite it."
He said "That means that we have to make new plates.
If you insist on rewriting and if you will dig up $27ill get the other $270 and we will make new plates."
Said my half of the new plates and rewrote the book to make it at least honest.
Butill don't like it because the whole conception was—was base.
It did sell and was going to make mot of money.
The publisher went bankrupt sot just exactly whaeserved anearned my lesson from it.
Since then I've remained amateur.
Yes sir.
why did you go back to those same characters in Requiem founes sir.
There was nothing wrong with the characters.
The—the conception of the—the first story was base because it was done not to tell about man in his tragic struggle but to make money.
That's why it was base.
But wheewrote it I'd already invested $270.
In those dayidn't have $270 every day.
Theid the besould to make a—an honest book out of it.
And the characters—there was nothing wrong with the characters just the—the concept of the book to begin with.
Yes sir.Sir in light of your friendship with Sherwood Anderson are you ariter indebted to him?
Or what is your opinion of his place in American literatureis—he has never been given his rightful place in American literature.
In my opinion he's the father of—of all of my generation Hemingway Erskine Caldwell Thomas Wolfe Dos Passos.
Of course Mark Twain is—is all of our grandfather.
But Sherwood Anderson has in my opinion has still to receive his rightful place in—in American letters.I know that this year's Nobel Prize winner ireat admirer of yours anonder if you could—what is your impression or thoughts of Camus ariter?
If you're acquainted with him ...enow Camus best and I—I think highest of him.
He is—is one man that—that has—is doing whaave tried always to do which is—is to search demand ask always of—of one's own soul.
That is my reason for saying that he is the best of the living Frenchmen better than Sartre or the others.
Malraux was a—he became obsessed with politics.
But Camus has stuck to his principles which was always to search the soul whichink is—is the writer's first job.
To search his own soul to givroper moving picture of man in—in the human dilemma.
Yes sir.Have you ever tried to writovel ... iorthern atmosphereaven'teckotick to Mississippi because I'm too lazy to do research.
As long atick to—to whanow—dialect habits customs folklore—thanow then nobody can check me on them and say "Uh uh you're wrong there.
This is the way they do it in New Hampshire."
But people are—are the same.
There's too little difference.
Anhink whean or woman writes about his own country he's not regional he's just too lazy to want to do any research.
Yes sir.How have you enjoyed your stay here in Virginia?
And do you think Virginia as an area is ... conducive ... as Yoknapatawpha countyelave been in Albemarle County off and on for two or three years now anave seeew Snopeses there.
Buike Virginia and Virginians.
The longetay in Albemarle County the more like Mississippians they behave but they don't have some of the—the Mississippi vicesave—I said last year thaike Virginians because they were snobs and since they seem to think I'm all right then maybm all right.
Yes sir.Are the Snopeses really taking over Jefferson and is there any group that might hold them outhe Snopeses will destroy themselveseally can't afford to answer that question sir because  you might not buy the next book io.
They were—that's the artist's prerogativhink is to emphasize to underline to—to—to blow up facts distort facts in order to state a—a truth.
The—there's probably no tribe of Snopeses in Mississippi or anywhere else outside of my own apocrypha.
They were simply an invention of mine to—to teltory of man in his struggle.
Thaas not trying to say "This is the sort of folks we raise in my part of Mississippi" at all.
That they were simply over-emphasized burlesqued if you like which is what  Dickens spenot of his time doing for a—a valid to him and to me reason which was to teltory ioving dramatic tragic or comical way.
Yes sir.What is your opinion of Henry Millerorron't know him.
Should I?
You must believe meo live in the country anon't keep up with literary thingsin'iterary man.
So ihould know Henry Milleill find out about it.
Yes sir.Along those lines do you think that the new American literature will develop and what will it have to say or is there nothing left ...t will have to say the same things that people have had to say and have been saying ever since man first found some way to—to paint pictures on the walls of the cave.
It's to tell about the—the eternal problems of man's heart which have nothing to do with atom bombs nor—nor labor unions nor the price of motor cars nor segregation nor integration.
It's man struggling with the eternal verities of—of the soul.
The young writer today aaid has got to—to resist that pressure to belong to groups to relinquish his—his capacity to think and judge into the—the mouth oommittee chairman.
But he will write about the same passions and hopes and aspirations and griefs that people have written about ever since whoever wrote the Old Testament.
His problem—what to write about is there.
He doesn't need ....
Yes sir.Would you say that the Snopeses are capable or incapable of participating in ...he ones which are incapable of it will—will be obliterated.
The Snopes will evolve into—you might say an acceptable type of Snopes.
Either that or he'll have to vanish.
That he will have to—to cope with his environment or his environment will destroy him.
Yes sir.You keep referring to the tragic struggle.
Sionder if you the artist's chief talent is to—in his ability to perceive this struggle or in his ability to put down the struggle once he's perceived it ...o perceive it maybe to sympathize with it.
Not to judge it but simply to sympathize with it to pity it.
If he perceives it and anguishes enough over it he will put it down.
He may not be able to spell nor punctuate either but somebody in the publisher's office will do that for him.
He will put it down if he perceives it and anguishes over it hates it or admires it or is troubled by it then he will put it down.
That will just take industry to work at it ruthlessness to throw away what is not quite good to keep at it.
Yes sir.Sir you mentioned Thomas Wolfe as being of your generation.
Would you comment on his place in American ...t's too soon to—to sahink.
It takes—takeittle time before the—the dross evaporates from anyone's work until there'istance forue perspective.
At one timas asked to—whahought of my contemporariesaid "It's too soon to tell."
The questioner said "Well haven't you got any opinion of them at all."
I—I said "Opinion of whoe named Wolfe Hemingway Dos Passos Caldwell and meated them then Wolfe first me second Dos Passos Caldwell and Hemingway.
Not on—on what we'd accomplished but only on the single general grounould find which was the—the attempt to do more than we could do on the failureated Wolfe because his was the most splendid failure.
He had tried hardest to take all the experience that he was capable of observing and imagining and put it down in one book on the head oin.
He had the courage to experiment to be—to write nonsense to be foolish to be sentimental in the attempt to get down the—that single moving and passionate instance of man's struggleated myself next becausad tried next hardest to get everything on one pageated the others down to Hemingway not on the value of his work whichought was per se the best because it was intact and complete.
But his was—showed less desire to try to get all of man's heart onto the pinhead.
Shink it's too soon for anyone to have a—have an opinion about Wolfe.
Maybe the only opinion to have about anybody is "Dike to read him or don't Ind iike to read him he's all right.
Ion't like to read him then he may be all right for somebody else but he ain't my cup of tea.
I think we have We certainly owur gratitude.
We certainly appreciate his good nature his stamina annow we want to ... thank him foeally memorable occasion.It's with pleasure thaake this introduction today because it's alwayleasure for me to introduce and for all of us to hear our speaker but it's with regret too because this is our last session today.
It's our last session with the world's greatest living novelist and with our own Writer-in-Residence who today will read from the book he has referred to as his favorite The Sound and the Fury.
He'll read from Dilsey's section and at the conclusion of his reading he will answer such questions as you care to put to him.
I'll resist at this time all temptations to quote lines of poetry to say ave atque vale or anything of that sort because we hope to see him again and again in Charlottesville in the years to come.pplause  Since this is my last day here in my sojourn as Writer-in-Residencould use this last hour to try to say thank you to the people of Albemarle County and Charlottesville and the University for making my stay here this pleasant and this happyon't do thaton't even say goodbye.
Every individual is the sum total of his past so wheeave herill leave something of  in Albemarle County where  was happy.
Wheo awaill take with me something of Albemarle Countyill always come back so that those two separates can be joined againon't need to say goodbye.
And each timome back I'll be saying "Much obliged."
The road rose again tcene likainted backdrop.
Notched intut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off likut ribbon.
Beside ieathered church lifted its crazy steeple likainted church and the whole scene was as flat and without perspective aainted cardboard set upon the ultimate edge of the flat earth against the windy sunlight of space and April anidmorning filled with bells.
Toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation the women and children went on in the men stopped outside and talked in quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing.
Then they too entered.
The church had been decorated with sparse flowers from kitchen gardens and hedgerows and with streamers of colored crepe paper.
Above the pulpit hunattered Christmas bell the accordion sort that collapses.
The pulpit was empty though the choir was already in place fanning themselves although it was not warm.
Most of the women were gathered on one side of the room.
They were talking.
Then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their seats and the congregation sat for an instant expectant.
The bell struck again one time.
The choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned its head as one as six small children—four girls with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies and two boys with close napped heads—entered and marched up the aisle strung together iarness of white ribbons and flowers and followed by two men in single file.
The second man was huge oight coffee color imposing irock coat and white tie.
His head was magisterial and profound his neck rolled above his collar in rich folds.
But he was familiar to them and so the heads were still reverted when he had passed and it was not until the choir ceased singing that they realised that the visiting clergyman had already entered and when they saw the man who—who had preceded their minister enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescribable sound went uigound of astonishment and disappointment.
The visitor was undersized ihabby alpaca coat.
He haizened black face likmall aged monkey.
And all the while that the choir sang again and while the six children rose and sang in thin frightened tuneless whispers they watched the insignificant looking man sitting dwarfed and countrified by the minister's imposing bulk with something like consternation.
They were still looking at him with consternation and unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in rich rolling tones whose very unction served to increase—increase the visitor's insignificance.
"En dey brung dat all de way fum Saint Looey" Frony whispered.
"I've knowed de Lawd to use cuiser tools den dat" Dilsey said.
"Hush now" she said to Ben.
"Dey fixin to sing again iinute."
When the visitor rose to speak he sounded likhite man.
His voice was level and cold.
It sounded too big to have come from him and they listened at first through with curiosity as they would have tonkey talking.
They began to watch him as they woulan oight rope.
They even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran and poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionless wire of his voice so that at last when witort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as reft of all motion aummy or an emptied vessel the congregation sighed as if it waked froollective dream and moveittle in its seats.
Behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily.
Dilsey whispered "Hush now.
Dey fixin to sing iinute."
Theoice said "Brethren."
The preacher had not moved.
His arm lay yet across the desk and he still held that pose while the voice died in sonorous echoes between the walls.
It was as different as day and dark from his former tone witad timbrous quality like an alto horn sinking into their hearts and speaking there again when it had ceased in fading and cumulate echoes.
"Brethren and sisteren" it said again.
The preacher removed his arm and he began to walk back and forth before the desk his hands clasped behind hieagre figure hunched over upon itself like that of one long immured in striving with the implacable earth "I got the recollection and the blood of the Lamb!"
He tramped steadily back and forth beneath the twisted paper and the Christmas bell hunched his hands clasped behind him.
He was likorn small rock whelmed by the successive waves of his voice.
With his body he seemed to feed that voice that succubus like had fleshed its teeth in him.
And the congregation seemed to watch with its own eyes while the voice consumed him until he was nothing and they were nothing and there was not eveoice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the need for words so that when he came to rest again against the reading desk his monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that oerene tortured crucifix that transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of no momenong moaning expulsion of breath rose from them anoman's—woman's single soprano "Yes Jesus!"
As the scudding day passed overhead the dingy windows glowed and faded in ghostly retrogradear passed along the road outside laboring in the sand died away.
Dilsey sat bolt upright her hand on Ben's knee.
Two tears slid down her fallen cheeks in and out of the myriad coruscations of immolation and abnegation and time.
"Brethren" the minister said iarsh whisper without moving.
"Yes Jesus!"
the woman's voice said hushed yet.
"Breddren en sistuhn!"
His voice rang again with the horns.
He moved his arm and stood erect and raised his hands.
"I got de ricklickshun en de blood of de Lamb!"
They did not mark just when his intonation his pronunciation became negroid they just sat swayinittle in their seats as the voice took them into itself.
"When de long cold—Oells you breddren when de long cold ees de light eees de word po sinner!
Dey passed away in Egypt de swingin chariots; de generations passed away.
Wuich man whar he noreddren?
Wuo man whar he noistuhn?
Oells you ef you aint got de milk en de dew of de old salvation when de long cold years rolls away!"
"Yes Jesus!"
"I tells you breddren eells you sistuhn dey'll comime.
Po sinner sayin Let me lay down wid de Lawd lemme lay down my load.
Den whut Jesus gwine sareddren?istuhn?
Is you got de ricklickshun en de Blood of de Lamb?
Casint gwine load down heaven!"
He fumbled in his coat and took ouandkerchief and mopped his faceow concerted sound rose from the congregation "Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!"
The woman's voice said "Yes Jesus!
Jesus!"
"Breddren!
Look at dem—dem little chillen settin dar.
Jesus wus like dat once.
He mammy suffered de glory en de pangs.
Sometime maybe she helt him at de nightfall whilst de angels singin him to sleep; maybe she look out de do en see de Roman po-lice passin."
He tramped back and forth mopping his face.
"Listen breddrenees de day.
Ma'y settin in de do wid Jesus on her lap de little Jesus.
Like dem chillen dar de little Jesusears de angels singin de peaceful songs en de gloryees de closin eyes; sees Mary jump up sees de sojer face We gwine to kill!
We gwine to kill!
We gwine to kill yo little Jesusears de weepin en de lamentation of de po mammy widout de salvation en de word of God!"
"Yes Jesus!
Little Jesus!"
and another voice rising "I seeesus!
Oees!"
and still another without words like bubbles rising in water.
"I sees hit breddrenees hit!
Sees de blastin blindin sightees Calvary wid de sacred trees sees de thief en de murderer en de least of deseears de boastin en de braggin Ef you be Jesus lif up yo tree en walkears de wailin of women en de evenin lamentationsears de weepin en de cryin en de turned-away face of God dey done kilt Jesus; dey done kilt my Son!"
"Jesuseeesus!"
"O blind sinner!

Breddrereddrenees de doom crack en hears de golden horns shoutin down de glory en de arisen dead whut got de blood en de ricklickshun of de Lamb!"
In the midst of the voices and the hands Ben sat rapt in his sweet blue gaze.
Dilsey sat bolt upright beside crying rigidly and quietly in the annealment and the blood of the remembered Lamb.
As they walked through the bright noon up the sandy road with the dispersing congregation talking easily again group to group she continued to weep unmindful of the talk.
"He shreacher mon!
He didn't look like much at first but hush!"
"He seed de power en de glory."
"Yes suh.
He seed hit.
Face to face he seed hit."
Dilsey made no sound her face did not quiver as the tears took their sunken and devious courses walking with her head up making no effort to dry them away even.
"Whyn't you quit dat mammyrony said.
"Wid all dese people lookin.
We be passin white folks soon."
"I've seed de first en de last" Dilsey said.
"Never you mind me."
"First en de last whutrony said.
"Never you mind" Dilsey said.
"I seed de beginnin en noees de endin."
Any question from anyone?
Yes ma'am.Do you think that there'articular order in which your works should be read ...?
Many people have offereequence.
Do you think there'articular sequence that your books should be read inrobably to begin witook called Sartoris.
That has the germ of my apocrypha in itot of the characters are postulated in that book.
I'd say that'ood one to begin with.Is the present moviompilation of various episodes in different novels?
For in—I'm thinking of the horse particularly.
Did that come from the "Spotted Horses" that's so much like it don't know ma'am because I'm nooving picture-goeraven't seen the movie.
audience laughteeally don't know.
My experience with moving pictures is that they have almost any reason for buying the book except to make it.
audience laughteemember M-G-M boughook of mine called The Unvanquished.
They were stories of the Civil Waround out later tharoducer named Selznick had bought Gone With the Wind and he wanted to use Clark Gable in the picture but Clark Gable belonged to M-G-M and M-G-M wouldn't let  Selznick have Clark Gable unless  Selznick let M-G-M make the picture which  Selznick wouldn't do so M-G-M hunted around for another book to buy of the Civil War to tell  Selznick they were going to makoneWith the Wind themselves if he didn't let them make his so they bought my book with no intention of making it.
Yes sir.I just wanted to ask you—out of your answer ... during the previous ... year it came out that you don't take full responsibility for your characters.
As if the created art with you was something unconscious noillful act didn't make that statement clear.
Whaaid was that I'm not responsible for the ideas and opinions that my characters express.
audience laughtessume responsibility for the people but they have their own ideas and opinions thaon't always agree with.
Yes ma'am.What is the reason that this book from which you read is your favorite novel think that—that no writer is ever quite satisfied with—with the book.
That's why he writes another one.
That he is trying to put on paper something that is going to bittle better than anybody else has put on paper up to date and this is my favorite one becausorked the hardest on it not to accomplish whaoped to do with it bunguished and—and raged over it more than over any other to try to make something out of it that it was impossible for—for me to do.
It's the same feeling that the parent may have toward the—the incorrigible or the abnormal child maybe.Has Requiem foun ever been acted on the stagees ma'am.
It's been knocking around Europe for the last six or seven years.
It has been in every language until last fall it was three weeks at the Court Theater in London.
It will be in—in New York this fall.
Yes ma'am.ave been trying to tracradition in your work and I'm curious to know whether you read Sir Walter Scott to any extent in the time previous to writing your novels.
Yes'idead everythinould get my hands on without any discretion or judgment at one time  and I'm sure that everything I've read from the telephone book up has influenced what I've done since.
audience laughtehink that's true of any writer.
Yes ma'am.Your books have been compared to Bach's fugues.
Do you objectively plan out that they're going to have that ... effect or does it just come naturallyell it's—it's not quite planned because probablm not capable of that buhink that there's too much work goes into—to any book to call iatural process.
But as—about reading any experience the writer has ever suffered is going to influence what he does and that is not only what he's read but the music he's heard the pictures he's seen and it wasn't thaent to Bach to—to get myself out of a—a—a jam in the work but probably whaad heard of Bach—at the moment wheeeded to use counterpoint there it was.
Yes ma'am.How do you arrive at names for your charactershe only rule is to do the best you can not to use the name of—of any living person because you'll spend the next ten or fifteen dollars in stamps explaining that you didn't mean so and so.
Characters quite often name themselves just like the story itself will select its own title.
Some people to me look and behave just like their names.
But—that ion't remember thaver any trouble trying to geame foharacterever had to—to look through city directories for names.
The—the people themselves said "I'm going to be named so and so."
Yes sir.What is the immediate stimulus that makes you writeh it'emon.
audience laughteon't know where it came fromhink every artist has got one.Do you think—what I'm trying..udience laughter .... Do you—do you think before you write or do you write—   Well I'm glad you stopped there.
Thank you.
Did—I thinnow what you mean by the stimulus.
It's—you're alive in the world.
You see man.
You have an insatiable curiosity about him but more than that you have an admiration for him.
He is frail and fragileb of flesh and bone and mostly water.
He's flung willy nilly intamshackle universe stuck together with electricity.
The problems he faces are alwayittle bigger than he is and yet amazingly enough he copes with them not individually but—but aace.
He endures.
He's outlasted dinosaurs.
He's outlasted atom bombs.
He'll outlast communism.
Simply because there's some part in him that keeps him from ever knowing that he's whippeuppose.
That as frail as he is he—he lives up to his codes of behavior.
He shows compassion when there's no reason why he should.
He's braver than he should be.
He's more honest.
The writer is—is so interested he sees this as so amazing and—and you might say so beautiful.
Anyway it—it's so moving to him that he wants to put it down on paper or in music or on canvas that he simply wants to isolate one of these instances in which man—frail foolish man—has acted miles above his head in some amusing or dramatic or tragic way.
Anyway some gallant way.
Thauppose is the incentive to write apart from it being funort of believe that is the reason that people are artists.
It's—it's the most satisfying occupation man has discovered yet because you never can quite do it as well as you want to so there's always something to wake up tomorrow morning to do.
You're never bored.
You never reach satiation.Sir are there particular reasons why you do not go to the movies?
Yes sir.
They come at the wrong time of day.
That's the time of daike to have two or three drinks and eat supper and then sit down and smoke and read.
If the—if they had moving pictures—welon't know I'd have something else better to do any time of day.
audience laughtehink maybe I'd rather read it than listen to it.
I'd rather read Shakespeare than see his plays.Would that apply to drama tooes sir.
I—I can count on my thumbs the plays I've seen in my life  and that's—one is Ben Hur.
The other is—was East Lynne.
audience laughteeckoas eight nine years oldemember Ben Hur because it had live horses in it anamel.
I'd never seeamel before.
Yes sir.
are there things you can know about the world that scientists can't you as an artisthink that—that the sort of factcientist knows no artist is really interested in.
That his interest is in the simple eternal fundamental truths of man's behavior not the facts of—of his behavior nor the facts he lives among.
That the—the writer is—is—has no concern with facts.
He'ongenital liar to begin with.
That's why they call it fiction.
That he makes his own facts just to suit whatever phase of—of the eternal truth he is trying to make dramatic.Have you ever been calleumorist think some of the thingrite is funny.
audience laughteon't know ....Sir how do you—how do you organize your—your novels?
Do you have any outline or do you just begin writing ithere's no rules for that.
Occasionally one is—is complete before you begin it which is tour de force but most of them begin with some incident in which man is acting in that gallant way despite his fragility.
Others begin witharacter who has in himself the seed of tragedy.
After that the—all the writer has to do is to run along behind witotebook and put down what they say and do.
They've taken charge by then—by then.
Yes ma'am.What emotion is the most difficult to describe?
...hy if you will agree that the writer is never quite satisfied with—with anything he does then none of them are difficult or none of them are easy.
That emotion—the emotion the character shows is simply one of the—the tools in the craftsman's toolbox and when he needs to show anger he can always steal from somebody else that has shown anger and copy it.
If he believes in his characters enough and they themselves have stood up on their own hind legs and begun to move then all he has to do is just put down what they say and do that he doesn't have to—to create emotional states for them.
They're doing that.
He just is the stenographer.
Yes ma'am.... go back.
I'm going to say the sentence structure is different in the later books than in the earlier ones.
Is that by intention or just an evolution in style prefer to think that—that no writer has got time to be too concerned with style that he is simply telling this dramatic instance in the most effective way he knows that the book the story creates its own style.
Long and involved sentences—I don't like them any—any more than the people that have to read them do buouldn't think of any to me better more effective way to tell whaas trying to tell.
And it's not really an evolution simply that—that one story in my opinion demanded compelleertain diction and style.
The story next to it has compelleompletely different one.
Yes ma'am.Going back to the movies do you mind that they buy your movie and then treat it in an entirely different way from the way you would want it to be treatedelouldn't have any wants in the matterave done the besould with that book myself.
It wasn't quite as good ahought it was going to be and I'm convinced that nobody can else improve on it  and every now and theikittle money myself  and so they are welcome to do whatever they want to because they can't really think of that book arote it.
Yes ma'am.It occurs to me that as Writer-in-Residence we are making you look for—backwards instead of forwards.
We are making you analyze what you've already done.
Has this affected your writing career think as long as the demon's on my back nothing can affect my writing careerhink that—that it—it pleases anyone to find that there are enough people who are moved or entertained by what he did to where they will—will come iroup like this asking questions.
It may be that that'oor habit for an—an aged writer like me to form that he will get to where he'd rather talk to folks than to go home and work.
In that way it may damage his worittle buuspect that—that when the writer's young and still hot he's not going to become Writer-in-Residence anyway.
He's too busy.
That when he begins to scrape the bottom of the barrel then he can  becomhilosopher anage but—  you would—do you prefer to creatood rather thalot when writing am simply writing about peopleave taken man in one of his amazing victories and have tried to put it down on paper.
If it takes plot to do that theill—will borrolot from somebody.
There ain't but two or three plots you know.
If—if it takeood theill hunt around to where somebody's written the sort—in memorean—where somebody has portrayed that mood anill borrow from him.Then you are writing an emotion not—'m writing about people.
Man involved in the human dilemma facing the problems bigger than he whether he licks them or whether they lick him.
But man as frail and fragile as he is yet he will keep on trying to be brave and honest and compassionate and that to me is very fine and very interesting and that is the reasohink any writer writes.
He's not trying to write style.
He's not trying to—to uplift to deliveessage.
He is simply writing abouan in the infinite mutations of—of man's capacity.
Yes sir.
Tanner Hunt Would you makort of general statement about the seed of tragedy as found in the hero of All the King's Men by  Warren don't know that book.
I—I read a—a story that was—was inside the story of—oan named Cass something.
That was the best part of that book.
As far as I'm concerned he can throw the rest of the book away but that iery fine story.
San't speak about that book.
I—I didn't read it with—with enough attention to—to remember it only that story of the man Caselieve.
do the critics bother you in any way or change the tenor or direction of your thinking or actions don't read critics.
I'd rather read imaginary fiction.
